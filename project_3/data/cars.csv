"On my 2010 Nissan Rogue S, the backlighting for the speedometer (lights behind 0-100 mph) would occasionally flicker between on &amp; off, and up until now they haven't turned back on. I can still see the numbers because the lights behind 100-160 mph work fine, along with the pointer's lighting. The issue is the same on the rpm side (just with the 6-8,000 rpm portion) which I did not include a picture of. I'm wondering if these are bulbs I could replace behind the combination meter, or if they're LEDs on a circuit board or something, making the issue more difficult to manage. I haven't checked any fuses yet or tested anything with a multimeter, but I feel like if it were a short the entire backlight would go out.

"I had a water leak in my car so took it to a shop for a fix. They did some work and sent it back to me but the leak persisted. I brought it back for a second time and the shop worked on it for quite awhile before declaring the problem fixed. They said it was the most stubborn leak they’ve worked on.

Well, I discovered yesterday that the car is still leaking, albeit a lot less than before.

This time, I pulled out the spare tire in the trunk to have a closer look at the water collecting in there. This is the first time I’ve done this myself.

I noticed a small circular metal plate that appears to be a plug hole welded in place; however, it appears that someone cut a small notch in the metal plate to allow water to drain out. I can see through the notch down to the street below. I assume this was the shop’s last ditch effort to prevent water from building up in my trunk.

"I bought an audi a6 c5 last year. it has a busted clutch. Or at least thats what we think it is since when the engine is shutdown it goes to every gear, like it click or snaps in to that gear. but when the engine is running it wont go to any gear. As hard as i push the shifter it wont go in to the gear but it doesnt make any grinding noise. But for now i have to take off the gearbox and change the clutch. The subframe that holds up the gear box wont come out. There is two points in the front of the sub frame that wont come out. The whole frame is like wiggly. i can move it up and down like 10 cm both ways but it still wont come out. My friend told me that the engine is heavy and its pinchit it down there.

"Hi All. Pretty novice mechanic so go easy! 

I have a 1999 Dodge Ram 1500 with a 5.2L V8. I recently replaced the radiator. In the process I also installed a [new thermostat](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000C7YRNM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) and [thermostat housing](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009LZQV80/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1).

Anyway.

There's a leak coming from around the t-stat housing. It pools inside the lip of the housing, but **nowhere else**. Almost seems as if it's coming up through a bolt hole. I've done this process *twice* now. Even with a Fel-pro gasket with RTV.

 I'm starting to wonder if maybe I have a defective or otherwise warped t-stat housing. Amazon fit-check, on a second glance says it won't fit. The manufacturer say otherwise. 

The linked t-stat housing, as per one comment suggests that the screws bottom out in the block and that a washer may be necessary. That actually makes a lot of sense. I've thought about just re-using the old t-stat housing, since it's been friends with that engine block for a few years now lol

It never leaked from there before, so the only solution I can think of is to find a proper OEM housing. 

 I don't see any indication of leaking from the hose, but I won't rule that out.",Coolant pooling inside thermostat housing flange,1.0,cars,Illustrious-Study503,True

A friend told me to try Iron-X by Carpros, but my only issue is that im concerned about my clearcoat, especially after repeated use. 

So my major questions are, Has anyone had this appear on your vehicle? Do you know what it is? How can i prevent it from coming back?

"TL; DR: Car not cranking, lights come on, and gear shift wont move. Car might have brake issues, electric issues, dont know. Already replaced the ignition switch to no avail.

I recently drove from Texas to Pennsylvania in my car. It has been good to me, but was definitely a fixer upper when I got it two years ago. I got a lot fixed on it before I left in November, so I should be good to go. I spent $1300 to get it straight. I got the power steering done, an alignment, my fluids changed, among a myriad of other things. I likely need an oil filter change now because of how far I have driven, oil is good.

Here's the situation I'm having:

1. All lights come on. The dash lights come on when I put the key in the ignition. Shouldn't be a battery issue. The car isn't cranking. When it would crank, it would take forever. However, it works perfectly when it is up and running. No jerking, no overheating, no misfiring, no grinding gears, no random stopping.
2. Automatic gear shifter is very resistant to changing gears. The button came off and we have had to use a pair of pliers to pull it out. Putting a key in the slot won't let me put it into neutral either.
3. I have recently changed out the ignition switch entirely, seeing it as a simple fix that could be the issue- it is not the problem. It still did not crank or change at all once entirely replaced.

I am not seeing any frayed/ rusted/ broken cables. The gear shift + not cranking makes me think this may be a brake issue. It is a little hard to brake compared to other cars I have driven but I think it might just be the car's quirk. It has never changed.

"So we know that some companies recently have been trying to save the ICE engine for motorsports, which is pretty cool because there will always be a special feeling that comes from driving pistons.

There are two ICE alternatives that are popular right now, Toyota with their hydrogen combustion engine, (NOT A FUEL CELL), and the other option is Porsches synthetic gasoline thing.

Honestly I feel like the hydrogen combustion idea has alot of problems with it and it's just really unrealistic, when fuel cells are so much more efficient I can't see how legislators or investors could ever get behind wasting time on that for motorsports or performance cars.

Porsches synthetic gas seems like a decent idea for motorsports however. Why doesn't Toyota stop wasting time and money on the hydrogen combustion and just work with Porsche?",Toyota should just work with Porsche instead of doing its own fuel.,1.0,cars,bfskinnerpsych,True

Hello, I have a 2012 VW CC with about 96k miles. I’m pretty sure my timing chain tensioner is about to eat shit because the car rattles on warm starts. I was just wondering how much roughly it would cost to get a new timing chain tensioner before the engine grenades itself.

If it costs over 1000 i’m probably just going to sell the car and save up to get a new car because the current used market is dogshit. Me being 18 though, it doesn’t seem like a new car is the best decision ill make over the course of my life.

Outside of the timing tensioner my car needs new breaks and rotors for all 4 wheels and could use a suspension refresh.

So i’ve come to ask for some seasoned car enthusiasts and older (than me) opinions on what I should do. Like I said i’m 18 (19 in a few days). I like my car but the timing tensioner repair seems like it’s going to be expensive as well as the other things I need to change out. I work for my money and I am thinking about just selling my car and using it as a down payment for a new honda civic SI. I know having a monthly payment as a young person is shit, but I do also have some money saved up. The used car route would be an option if the market didn’t suck absolute balls like it currently does.

So do I repair my car, or get something new. Keep in mind i’m also in college going for a mechanical engineering degree, and I plan on driving alot of internships etc in the near future.

Hi! Tomorrow I’m going out to look at a 2001 Chevrolet Camaro Base model convertible with 64,000 miles, listed for $3,500. 

So far, I’ve spoken to the seller through text and on a phone call, and from what they’ve described, the car functions well mechanically, and after looking at the photos it appears to be in good shape. 

Of course, when I get there, there are a variety of other things I want to see. I’ll text the acceleration, brakes, power steering, as well as the electrical functions, and I’ll look under the car to see how the undercarriage rust is. Also plan to push on it a little to test the shocks. 

I’m going with my dad so I can get an extra set of eyes to point out any potential flaws/issues. Also plan to run a carfax report if the car looks promising. 

However, I’m not all that familiar with how signing over the car works, and also the need to get insur ance to drive it back to my house. It’s only 8 miles away, but I’m still paranoid to not have it during those 8 miles.

One obvious answer is the Alfa Romeo 4c, which I think if it had a manual transmission would be considered an instant classic and very highly regarded. Frankly the engine size and power are fine for the size and weight of the car, but a manual does really fit the nature of the car and I’m sure if it had the option for one it would go down as one of the best modern enthusiast cars.

"
I was born in a 1986 Opel Corsa A (aka Chevy/Vauxhall Nova), fire red, slammed, complete cage, C20LET engine from a Calibra tuned to 260hp and really clean. As a baby I already slept better when I was in a car. When I lost my mum in 2006 (I was only 5) my father began to abandon me so one of my norwegian uncles took more and more care of me. We buildt several cars, the one I loved most was a 1996 Toyota Supra MK4 he bought in 2009. We completely stripped it down and rebuildt it for 3 years. I could wish whatever I want for that car, he even followed my childish dreams and installed a NOS direct injection (I cried of joy when I saw the big bottles in the trunk installed, two 20lbs bottles). I really loved that car, whenever I got to him he picked me up in the Supra. One day in 2017 he drove to us, in a rented 2012 VW Passat, nothing special (the Supra would have been too expensive in gas for over 1400km as you might can think). About 500km away from me he was forced off the road and fell 7m deep into the woods. He died even before he reached the bottom I was told. That was already killing me inside, that I would never see him again. But on top of that his wife decided to ignore the last will of him, she sold all cars of him several weeks later, to Russia, even the Supra (which would have been mine due to the last will of my uncle). Because I neither know any chassis number nor the next owner I will NEVER. EVER. see this car again in my life, Russia is big. This is really killing me from inside till today, I didn’t even lost my fav person on this earth, I also lost my personal hero car, the Supra that saved my childhood, that was buildt like in my dreams by my uncle and me.

I recently just moved from Texas to Philly. I've never had any issues with my 2012 Corolla before in Texas, but within a week of being in Philly I've had my wiper fluid freeze/not come out, and more importantly my car wouldn't turn over.

In the ""halfway"" position my car lights could turn on radio etc but forcing it into the engine running position it wouldn't start. I tried jumping it, but that didn't work. After maybe 5-10 min of trying over and over, it finally sputtered to life and I could drive it around.

However, I'm also worried because I felt like I could smell gasoline coming from the ac/heat vents as I just drove it around.

"Most people in the know, have heard the story that CVTs were banned by Formula 1 after the 1993 season because the teams using them were seeing significant performance advantages over the teams using traditional transmissions, and Formula 1 wanted to restore the competitive balance to their series. In the consumer market, the CVT has made its way into numerous brands and the models they put out, but they seem to have a reliability issue as far as parts and breakage (looking mainly at you Nissan), and they are considered, I guess, ""boring"" would be the best way to describe them.   


Hypothetically speaking, if Formula 1 had never banned the CVT from usage and impacted further research and development on it by racing teams, would the CVT have been implemented into more higher power/torque consumer oriented sports cars, and if so, would it have garnered a different opinion of them by the automotive community?","If Formula 1 Had Never Banned the CVT, Would Manufacturers Have Been More Inclined to Develop It Further for Use in Higher Power/Torque Cars?",1.0,cars,flea_420,True

"Hi guys, 1st time posting here and really asking anyone about this so bear with me.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of years ago I got as a gift from my father a 2011 Tiguan 1.4 TSI engine (122hp), manual transmission. After some time driving in and a couple of times with my father by my side, he said that I'm driving at quite a low RPM. I used to change gears at around 2.5k RPM and while in CC I would leave it anywhere between 1.5 - 2k RPM. After he gave me this advice, I tried to change in upper gears at around 3-3.5k RPM  which helped with the car being more responsive (especially in 4th and 5th gear when accelerating, the car felt more responsive, as it had more 'torque?' not sure if it's the right word.) 

With this change I feel like I'm driving more aggressive which is not necessarily my style and it also increases gasoline consumption.

"Hey everyone, first time EJ builder looking for some suggestions. I’ve wanted a blob eye with a stroker kit  since the model has come out years ago. I was fortunate enough to obtain my dream car about a year ago in a “work in progress” state with a unverified “replaced motor”. 

Long story short, the motor did what I anticipated it would do and cease to function properly. 

Since the failure I’ve pulled the motor and contacted a reputable engine builder near me that exclusively builds EJ motors. They use the Manley 2.1 stroker kit with the nitrided 2.5 crank. I’ve also opted for port&amp;polished heads, 2mm over stock intake valves and 1mm over stock exhaust valves, oil cooler delete and decked block. 

Supporting mods are

McLeod 6 puck clutch
ACT lightweight flywheel
X-force SS equal length header w/ catless up pipe
Blouch TDO5H-16GXT turbo
Turbosmart external wastegate w/various springs to interchange (11psi OD, 10psi middle, 7psi inner)
750cc Deatchworks injectors
Wahlbro 255lph fuel pump
Injen cold air intake
COBB accessport 
COBB 3 port boost controller 
Grimmspeed TMIC
GFB blow off valve 
Unknown down pipe w no cat
3” stainless exhaust to muffler
Killer B oil pick up tube
And various gaskets

"I got my 2009 Cadillac with 78k miles for $28,500 on October 2020. It came with a 3 month warranty.

I added a dual catch can, aftermarket Varimax cooling pump, Air Raid cold air intake, I Reinforced my supercharger brick and I replaced the supercharger isolator with a solid one.

These are all basic mods recommend for reliability.

August 2021. I am at 97k miles at this point. I am doing some light spirited driving, I shift from 3rd to 4th, and then smoke came out and something popped. Pulled it over. Oil everywhere.

Towed to shop, the engine is absolutely toast. Piston through the block, supercharger possibly contaminated.

Quoted $18k for a brand new LSA installed. 
$15k at another shop.. Most LSA are $10-12k by themselves. 

It's been almost 6 months since then and I hurt every single day. 

I was able to purchase a 06 scion xa as a daily to get around for $1700. The Xa is refreshing tbh because in the V, I was getting 10mpg.

I plan to pay my car down to about $14-16k and sell it as is. 

Hopefully  by the end of the year I can sell it and get into a C5 or C6. 

I only go to drive my car about 11 months and it was the funnest fastest car I ever had owned.

All I will say is, I probably bit off more than I could chew on my purchase but I am extremely lucky I have a job I can WFH and afford this without ruining my life lol. I totally understand why non car enthusiasts choose Accords, Camrys and Sonatas.

"As stated above I have a 2013 Hyundai Accent hatchback. When I got it in 2013 it only had 350 miles and since then I’ve put 131k miles on the car. It’s never had any major issues (had some repairs done twice after being rear ended over 5 years ago but nothing recent). As far as I’m aware I’ve never changed the spark plugs or any fuses or even the brake pads (have been told at every inspection that everything looks good). A few days ago it started to automatically lock the doors. Now it’s supposed to automatically lock them once you put the car in drive, but beyond that the only other ways I’ve locked the car are with the key fob and the door lock buttons. Now any time I open or close the drivers side door all of the locks will lock/unlock/lock repeatedly. If I unlock it with the key fob the doors will immediately lock back. It doesn’t matter if the car is on or not, if the keys are in the ignition, or what button I press, it just automatically locks. I’m terrified I’m going to accidentally lock myself out of my car, I can’t even unlock the doors to open the trunk cause it locks back immediately. Any ideas if this is a fuse issue?

"I finally picked up my GT3 Touring and want to share it with you. First of all, this post is not for showing off a rather expensive car. Any car enthusiasts who has ever picked up a car he/she looked forward to knows the feeling of the first days, weeks and months. This post serves to express a few of my first thoughts. 

The car in question is a 992 GT3 Touring/manual. It's actually my first PTS/CXX car ever and my last too. I've always laughed about people showing off their special paint color instead of driving the damn car, but hey here I am: this car is meant to be a forever car so I thought it would be a good occasion to pull the trigger on my first and last customisted 911. But I can reassure all car enthusiasts:  This car won't end up as a picture queen like some instagram users love to do it with their GT-cars. It will be my daily driver that will be used on the Nürburgring and great montain roads near to me too. 

So here are some [pics](https://imgur.com/a/Ln1N69q/).

First impressions:  
You probably expect me to praise the car above all else now. But I have decided not to do that. I pretty sure you don't want to hear another one raving about a Porsche GT-product like every YT video does. Also I haven't spent a lot of time in my car yet, but I have spent some time with  customer's 992 GT3 on track doing suspension tuning, track alignment,.... Long story short: yes, on track the double wishbone setup is a game changer for the 911 platform and all the praise you hear is true. I'll leave it at that and will do a detailed review regarding driving dynamics in some months. For now basically every credible review represents my opinion on this car. 

Actually, the previous paragraph only serves as a transition to the next paragraph. Yes, the 911 is changing. More front end grip, less rear biased. Less 911 in the end. 

Here is the thing: I have been fortunate enough to have driven basically every performance oriented car built in the last 20 years. My true love, when it comes to cars, is for the 911 itself, in all its shapes and sizes. From an 912 to a 67'911R to a 964Turbo to a 993GT2 to my 997 GT3RS, there is something wrong with all of them that somehow grows on you until it feels exactly right. A Rennlist comment I've seen some months ago summed it up very well: For me it's that wayward tail rotating, and the way you need to catch it with a quick dab of counter-steer on turn-in when you're really getting after it. That feeling of balancing a 911's tail on the knife-edge (and getting it right) on both the entrance and exit of a corner is my nirvana: simultaneously tricky, thrilling and tast. 

It's that exact feeling that modern technology used in 991, 992 GT-cars like rear wheel steering, double wishbone and more is designed to eliminate. Yes you can still enjoy lurid slides under power on exit, but a 991.2, let alone a 992 doesn't need to rotate on turn-in, it just turns and goes.  By every rational standard that's better- it means quicker transitions, faster slaloms and generally more faithful response to the driver's inputs. I am track rat, I love all the improvements when it comes to my 2RS and this 992 gen will be even better. Yet somehow to me that makes it less of a 911, and that means for all its greatness I love it slightly less.  So for me my 997 is a better drive than this 992, but I'll stipulate that it's a slightly certifiable conclusion based on my own personal psychosis. 

The car industry is changing and so is the sports car market. Things like the GR86 and MX5 are rare exceptions, everything has to be the fastest car on the road while being more comfortable than a 5-year old S-Class. The first drives with the 992 made the impression that Porsche's GT departement has lost this fight against the modern car industry to a certain degree. Just one example: A 991 is way worse in terms of NVH: more noises you can actually hear in the interior like injector noise, throttle flap and RWS pump- just to name a few. Just a reminder: the 991 was critizied for being more GranTourer than sports car. 

Like every modern sports car on sale nowadays the 992 is even worse (or better depending on how you see it) But all of the noises represent the core identity of what a GT3 should be in my opinion: as little to no filtering as possible. Raw. Unfiltered. Unrefined. Less power steering, less noise deadening, less clutch assist, less carpet, less muffling exhaust, all of this makes a car raw. OPF, lighter clutch, lighter steering, more sound insulation, all of this makes it less raw. In my opinion a GT3 exists to not take your wife to a nice restaurant. A GT3 should make every drive as special as possible, every drive should be special. It still does that better than any other modern cars, but it definitely lost some of the magic over the last generations. Lotus has lost the fight, so it's more than understandable that a German premium manufacturer will loose it too. At least they are trying to make some driver focused cars. 

I hope nobody thinks now that I'm spoiled boy buying car after car without appreciating it. Believe me I do, I am aware of my privilege and I love this car, I love cars from all brands at all price points. But I definitely won't stop critizing modern developments when it comes to sports cars. I'm daydreaming here but the EV 718 could be Porsche's biggest opportunity to make the 911 with all its different variants more driver-focused, lighter and smaller. It won't happen - I know.

But what if a car had 2 engines? 1 normal engine for acceleration, and the other possibly located at the real axle a 1 cylinder efficiency optimized that puts around 30 HP which is direct driven and with single speed with just a reduction gear, it could even be air cooled due to a single cylinder engines surface efficiency for air cooling and the low power requirement. It could be a simple engine with simple exhaust, intake, without valve timing or lift could be cheap and pay itself by low fuel consumption in a short time.   
The biggest issue could be with the displacement tax but that could be solved by making the master engine smaller yet giving it more aggressive cams to overcome the power deficit.

"I bought a 2013 Mitsubishi Lancer with 2 liter engine and a CVT gearbox.

The CVT default settings attempt to keep fuel usage down, and after getting used to it, it seemly ""works"".

But this car has two major issues:

1. It still kinda guzzle gas compared to others.

2. The response time is terrible, and the CVT notoriously make the car go into ""limp mode"" if it feels a sudden amount of power or if it overheats (something it often does too in my country :S )


Lancer Evo and Ralliart both have Turbos, and the car even has a slot for putting the Turbo, and with Manual Gearbox owners putting Turbo is a popular option to increase fuel efficiency (if you are not lead-footing) or performance (if you are shoving your foot in the pedal happily). But I heard this doesn't work on the CVT (it makes it freak out and go into limp mode when the Turbo finishes spooling up and kicks in suddenly).

I saw some people suggesting supercharger, but I also heard they use MORE fuel instead...

Also I heard some people saying the Lancer in stock engine settings use a excessively rich mixture that wastes fuel AND power.

While doing so I noticed that the complete lack of tech made the car feel old...really old. Back in 2010, a car from 2000 didn't feel all that old. Heck, a mid-to-late-90s car didn't even feel all that old back then. But now in 2020, a 2010 car feels much older than the 10 years would have me think. I suspect in 2030, a car from today is going to feel downright ancient.

"After owning my E46 for 6 months, I've realised its not the car for me. It's not that the car is terrible, its far from it, but it doesn't deliver what I seek for in a car. It's an automatic transmission with a 6 cylinder and oddly enough feels too modern and well engineered regarding it's handling. I don't feel any thrill or engagement when I do drive the car spiritedly, and feel awfully disconnected. 

I've opted for an older style hatchback civic as it's not only far more economically friendly, but also offers exactly what I want from a car especially as a manual, however, my family is very against the idea of such and wants me too keep the E46.

"I recently had the windshield on my SUV replaced, due to a crack.

I noticed that there were a couple vertical lines in the glass that would bend light, making it wavy. Which was kind of distracting to drive with. These weren't wide sections of glass, but the distortion would stretch top to bottom of the glass.

I brought it back to the shop and they brought in a new windshield and replaced it again free of charge.

The new one has the same thing, only in slightly different areas of the pane. (Same region, but shifted a few inches)

"I brought my car for an oil change Jan 18 and was told that the air cabin filters also needed to be changed but they didn’t have them in that day.

Jan 19 I notice my car smells like burning. My boyfriend doesn’t smell it. I think they must have spilled oil and it’s burning off.

Jan 31 the burning smell continues so I call mechanic, mention burning smell, ask could it be the cabin filters, they say yes. I bring it in Feb 1 to have cabin filters changed 

Still smells like burning. My boyfriend STILL doesn’t smell it. I notice driving to work one morning that my car seems to have a ton of smoke coming out exhaust, which is never had before. Forget to mention it to boyfriend. Also, around this time I notice what looks like an oil leak while I’m shoveling snow. Right around here my car would be parked.

February 19, my boyfriend borrows my car, calls me up while he’s out with it to tell me it smells like burning (no shit, I’ve been saying that for 3 weeks). My boyfriend finally checks the oil, and the car has about 4 qts too much oil, and this is after it has been driven around and leaking oil for 26 days.

I brought it back to the mechanic yesterday, they’re trying to minimize the issue, but I’m just wondering, is my engine fucked?

"You may (or more likely, may not) remember Fittipaldi Motors, and their 2017 concept track car, the EF7 Vision Gran Turismo. As the name suggests, it was designed for the Gran Turismo Sport video game, however Fittipaldi stated that they intended to make 39 real examples, and each buyer would get driver coaching from Emerson Fittipaldi himself. 


Since then however, we've basically heard nothing. Only one physical car was built (as a showcar) and since 2019 the company website no longer exists. 


I've been doing some digging online go find out more and found a comment saying that in the project's infancy in 2016, Emerson Fittipaldi was actually over $20million in debt and the Brazillian courts had seized some of his race-winning cars. However I wasn't able to verify a source. 


Any information on that story and what happened to the company in general would be very interesting to read about, so feel free to share any information as it's hard to come by.

Cool things I've read:
Wartsila two stroke marine diesels have a bore wear of something ridiculously small like .3mm per 1000hrs run time

Porsche 9a1 engine used in the gt3 generally gets  recommended rebuilds after 100 hrs of track time.

Yamaha 300hp outboards survive 1000+ hours of over 5000rpm with no real side effects

Honda Elements seem to have headgasket issues at 250k miles no matter how well maintained they are, I assum it's due to being underpowered?

"This was a question I have been thinking about in the car world.

Now, just a disclaimer. This **DOES NOT** apply to entry-level luxury cars or the lower end of the luxury range. 

Earlier, I have seen entry-level luxury cars/lower end of the luxury range compared to nicer mainstream vehicles. However, that seemed to go a bit further. Now people are comparing slightly more expensive luxury cars to mainstream cars (particularly those in the $40K range or above)

There was a comparison between the Lexus ES vs. Nissan Maxima. The opinions on whether this comparison is valid or not has been mixed. But, IMO I am confused about this comparison. The Lexus ES is a FWD-based comfort sedan and the Nissan Maxima is a flagship Nissan intended for performance (a little more powerful than the other sedans the lineup). Both vehicles have ENTIRELY different driving purposes. The ES has a quiet cabin, has a bit more of a comfortable interior, has better reliability, and has better customer care from Toyota/Lexus. The Maxima on the other hand is a bit more performance oriented. 

There was also a comparison between the [Audi RSQ8 vs. Jeep Trackhawk done by the YouTuber carwow.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kseCI_f3rZY) Although it was an interesting video, I didn't really understand the comparison. The Trackhawk starts at $90K while the RSQ8 starts at $114K. That is a bit far off in pricing. The RSQ8 like the Lexus ES will be slightly quieter, have better customer care from brand, have slightly nicer materials. (Speaking from an RSQ8 buyer perspective)

On a reddit post, some car enthusiasts mentioned a comparison between a Jeep Wrangler and a Porsche Boxster. The starting price for the Boxster is $62K while the Wrangler is $29K. The reasoning seemed to be the fact they are both ""convertibles"". I am still a bit confused. 

Here are some questions to expand this topic (you can answer any one):

1. Why do people compare luxury cars to cars from mainstream brands?
2. Why do some car enthusiasts say, ""Why not get &lt;insert mainstream car&gt; over &lt;insert luxury car&gt;?""

A while ago I was watching an F&amp;F movie (don't judge, it wasn't by choice), the one with the Formula One-looking ramp car (I think it's the 6?). When the car first appears one of the ""bad guys"" is working on it and says he is changing the spark plugs. A few minutes later, however, it's stated that the car has a Diesel engine.

Now, from my (admittedly little) knowledge about cars, I had always heard that Diesel engines don't use spark plugs. At the same time, however, I remember reading that high-performance Diesel engines do use spark plugs, but my memory is fuzzy about it

"I drive a 2012 Civic coupe, and I love the interior of it. It's well made, well designed, and with about 150k miles on it, it is holding up very well except for a little bit of wear on the top of the steering wheel and some wear on the steering wheel volume controls.

Before the Civic, I drove a 2007 Camry, and despite liking the layout of the Civic more, I didn't mind the Camry's interior and it held up well to the absolute abuse an early 20s driver gave it. 

I'm shopping for a 2014-2016 Civic Si right now, and decided to cross shop Ecoboost Mustangs from about the same years for comparison's sake. Not only are they more expensive than the Si coupes I'm looking at, the interiors of them are all terrible and worn about despite having less than 100k miles on them.

My brother has a 2013 Focus hatchback, and it's a year newer than my Civic and the interior looks like it's about 20 years older with how much black paint is peeling off the plastic in the interior. The 1992 Nissan pickup that I own is holding up better after 30 years than his Focus.

"I’m a Gen X guy who has seen the transformation of 70’s gas guzzling low HP engines to today’s engineering marvels. I remember my father bemoaning how the old V8s would be lucky to make it 100,000 miles before needing rebuilding. Some transmissions would last forever and others would need overhauling but at least it was cheap. Today engines have improved and transmissions gotten much more sophisticated. This I believe is a blessing and a curse. It’s not uncommon for engines to last 250,000 miles or more (if you get a good one.) However, transmissions seem much less reliable and are terribly expense to rebuild or replace. 

IMHO the auto manufacturers have created a mine field of what to buy and what not to buy. An auto manufacturer can have an excellent, reliable engine design and also have engines that are total bombs with various issues from oil consumption, timing chain problems, leaking seals, up to premature engine failure. Similarly some transmissions develop valve body problems, solenoid issues, internal seal problems, and premature failure. 

It seems as if a used car buyer who lacks warranty protection has to navigate an enormous amount of information to find the cherry amongst the lemons. Perhaps it’s just me getting older but it almost seems like peak automobile reliability occurred around 2000 - 2005.

"First off, I am not shaming manual transmissions, I think they are a fantastic way to drive. I am simply commenting about people who judge others for driving automatic transmissions.

When people say, you HAVE to buy the miata or whatever car in a manual transmission, simply replace ""you"" with ""I"" and there ya go. Because the truth is, YOU want the manual transmission, and that's fine! But why would you try to force other people to drive manual? Or judge people who like paddle shifting and being able to go into automatic during traffic or city travel? Some automatic transmissions are pretty damn good and shift faster than the average manual driver too. I totally get the appeal of a manual, and if that's the only way for you to drive, more power to you! Just please, if you are one of these people who are elitist about manuals, I encourage you to take a step back and ask yourself why you care what other people drive. Some people hate having to worry about a clutch, some people just wanna cruise, so let them. 

I personally have my miata with the automatic transmission, but 99% of the time i'm in manual mode, shifting the gears with the paddles and having a blast. Would I feel more connected to the transmission in the manual? Yes. Would I enjoy the smooth gearbox? Of course! But! Would I hate having to worry about the clutch in traffic? YES! Would I get tired of it after the novelty wears off at times and wish I could just have a relaxing drive? ABSOLUTELY! 

I'm sure most people reading this already know what im talking about, but for those of you who do say things like ""The only way to drive is manual"" etc. Just know you come off as an elitist close minded person.

"I had an Audi A1 1.6 TDI in my driving school and I always wanted to drive 100% smoothly with imperceptible shifting and coming to a complete stop, so I discovered rev matching on downshifts.

One time, I did such a perfect rev match that no computers and machines could do better, literally 100.00% perfect, not just 99.99%. When I did that, the clutch pedal that is normally heavy and with plenty of resistance, suddenly felt unbelievably light as I was taking my foot off it, like it just got disconnected from everything, like a blank pedal in a car with no engine or anything.

What's the cause of this sensation? It felt surreal, as well as the rev matched downshift from 4th to 3rd that was so perfect that I thought I accidentally put it into the neutral position.

I highly recommend this to everyone, by the way. You can ""catapult"" your foot off the clutch pedal as quickly as possible, like the natural reflex when you touch boiling hot water, yet you will not be able to feel even the slightest jerk, just as if you shifted into the neutral position.

Hey everyone. I have a few questions  regarding my A/C issue, if there's a better subreddit you could redirect  me to that would also be greatly appreciated.

Unfortunately  i drove around whilst my evaporator was struggling with a blockage and  it eventually sprung a leak in the evaporator coil itself so now the A/C  is no more! I know this because the evaporator box in the passenger  foot well would ice up whilst the A/C was working for about 5 minutes  and then the A/C would stop giving me cold air. The evaporator box would  defrost itself once the car was off and then repeat that process next  time i jumped in the car. I was also able to stick my phone camera up  through the fan blower housing to get a peak of the evaporator, and that  wet spot (refer to video) seems to indicate to me where my new leak is?  Would that stain be refrigerant, the oil or both? For anyone who's  interested, this 1999 HZJ75R Toyota TroopCarrier has spent its life  around Australia, that outback red dust is in every crevice of the  vehicle and you'll never get rid of it all!

*Processing video z08h15sos5h81...*

Fortunately,  the evaporator is accessible within 20 minutes or so underneath the  glove box. Am i right to assume i can safely release the engine bay high  and low side lines myself now as there should be no more refrigerant  (R134A) left in the system? I've been driving around for a few months  now whilst it's been dead. I've already matched and ordered the right  replacement evaporator coil and drier. I plan to install the evaporator  and drier and then have an A/C tech come out the same day to pull a  vacuum on the system and then regas the system. Oil wise (PAG46) i know  that when replacing a component you should drain whatever oil is in the  old component, record how much there was, and then replenish with the  same amount of fresh oil. However, since the evaporator has been leaking  will i even be able to replenish with the correct amount of oil again? I  know that a slight difference of too little or too much oil in the A/C  system can be detrimental but then I've also heard of people replacing  components and not even adding oil and they've been fine. Am i able to  replenish this oil into the components themselves?

Thanks for reading and i would appreciate any advice or guidance!",1999 Toyota TroopCarrier HZJ75R Evaporator Replacement,1.0,cars,RsRenee,True

"I just bought a used 2012 gti with some known flaws that I am planning to get fixed soon. It is also my first stick shift and I am starting to learn to drive it. Today I stalled a couple of times just learning to get going in 1st and I noticed a CEL was on. I'm not sure if this was before or after I stalled. I believe this happened after I stalled the car because I didn't notice this when I started the car and this light was not on two days ago when we drove the car two hours to its new home. This is where I might have messed up. I was given an OBDeleven scanner by the previous owner because he no longer had use for it, and I decided to check the code causing the check engine. The software is not very easy to read and I saw a couple of codes for the engine, including a couple of logged misfires and something else about high fuel flow if I remember correctly (which I probably don't). I believe this was due to my stalls, but this car has a history of building up carbon and misfiring on cold starts. 

I think I messed up when I was trying to look around for more information and accidentally cleared the code and turned the CEL off with the OBDeleven software. I am going to take the car to a VW specialist for a number of issues that need to be addressed on the car but I wanted to keep the CEL on for the mechanic to investigate or wait for it to go away on its own. I honestly would be happier if it came back on so a proper investigation as to what was causing the CEL to come on instead of me clearing it without knowing the root cause of the issue. I've restarted the car multiple times and it hasn't come back on since. Will the CEL come back on if the issue persists or will the ECU just ignore if that same type of issue pops up again? I'm kicking myself for not even writing the codes down before doing anything else with the software. 

TL;DR, 

Stalled a car with a history of engine misfires on cold starts, CEL popped up either after stalling or on startup this morning, tried to use an OBDeleven tool, accidentally cleared the codes without writing them down because I'm not familiar with the software.

Before  yesterday I went to an oil change place to change oil. My car's hood  had issues opening because the piece that you use to pop it is broken,  and it takes pliers and some strength to pull on a wire to pop it. So I  told them how to open it, they did and after initial tire, lights  inspection, the guy didn't close it all the way for the next service guy  who will be doing the oil change.

They  changed oil, and the last guy didn't close it all the way, but I didn't  know this at the time. I drove around yesterday, in town, so speeds at  most 40MPH, and then went on the freeway going Southbound in traffic, so  went slow. And today again, drove in town and Southbound with somewhat  slow speeds at maybe 50 MPH since there were a were cars on the freeway.

Later  this evening, I got on the freeway going Northbound, now past traffic  time, so going 60MPH. I noticed my hood acting weird, so I was trying to  see if it's a reflection or what (it was late night in the dark), then  all of the sudden the hood pops up, slams into my windshield and I can't  see the freeway. I immediately turn on emergency blinkers and pull  over. Front hood is bent and windshield is cracked. I slam my hood shut  and make sure that it is shut and proceed home. I called the oil change  place and the customer service was still open, so they took down my  message and emailed the manager.

What  are my chances of getting reimbursed for this, because it's 100% their  fault for not shutting it all the way. I hope they have cameras in place  to review. The guy working on it was cool, and I didn't see that it  wasn't shut all the way. But I do know it's their fault. Thanks.",Damage liability question,1.0,cars,getoffmylaaawn,True

Soooo now what do I do? I’m a total noob. I was so proud I did 3 myself. My main question is how unsafe to drive my car would it be? I know mustangs use their front brakes the most.

"Hey all, this is probably a stupid question.

I have the AstroAI 10000 counts LCD display thing meter. Super cool unit, double fused and all. I decided to give it a try by doing a parasitic draw test on my C6.

Hooked everything up correctly, and locked the car, tripped the hood latch too. At first it showed 1.2 A, then very quickly went down to 150 mA, then a couple minutes later down to 10 mA. Success! No parasitic draw. Bounced between 0.009-0.012A.

Then my stupid ass thought, “what if I hit the unlock button? What would the draw be when unlocked?”

So I hit the unlock button on my fob. Well the car did something and the meter immediately shouts at me “FUSE” with a red light.

I connected the battery up normally and all seems well, did I just blow the fuse in the meter? It’s a 10A 250v per the manual.

I feel kinda stupid right now.","Did parasitic draw test, then blew fuse in the meter, did I screw something up in my car?",1.0,cars,EmperorDorito,True

"TL;DR The steering wheel is impossible to micro adjust with one finger while cruising because of a certain ""threshold"" you need to overcome.

So I got the 2020 ford fiesta with the 1.0 ecoboost and the manual 6 for about a year now. At first my expectations where very low. I always drove a bit more luxurious cars before I got this one from my employer as a lease. But it turns out to be a great car actually, cost wise and comfort wise. Except for one fatal annoyance:
The steering wheel seems to have a certain threshold which you need to overcome. So when I'm cruising on the highway and the car goes a bit too much to the side I want to very gently move the steering wheel with my finger, but the steering wheel resists... until I apply so much pressure that it moves way to much. So as a result the car is borderline impossible to cruise comfortably for long distances, constantly having to ""fight"" with the steering wheel.

"Hi Everyone, 

Figured I’d give my brand perspectives as a manager of a fleet of university vehicles. Few notes to begin:

* I’ve been in this position for a few years, and have the ability to see every dollar of maintenance that’s been spent on these rigs.
* I drive these cars daily and feel like I have a decent perspective on reliability. 
* All my vehicles are larger, often 4x4 SUVs or trucks, and gas engines. All types of trim levels. 
* They get driven pretty hard. Often on dirt/mud for much of their life. 
* I definitely haven’t managed all brands out there, and clearly, this is mostly anecdotal, but I’m doing my best to be as objective as possible. 

Chevy/GM

Pro

* Damn comfortable. On highways, the independent front even in the bigger rigs rides nicely. The interior is plush and visibility is often good. 
* Smooth and powerful engines. 
* Good paint, at least on my rigs. 

Con

* My least favorite of the bunch overall. Easily the most expensive in maintenance. 
* Interior is nice while new, but does not hold up to abuse as good as some others. 
* Feels like I’m driving a couch

&amp;#x200B;

Toyota

Pro

* Honest reliability for decades. Very affordable to maintain
* Good price new for what I’m able to unload them for used down the road

Con

* Lagging a bit behind in tech and comforts. NO POWER SEATS TACOMA!?
* Engines/transmission combos make it feel underpowered, especially in the 4runner and tacoma 

&amp;#x200B;

Ford

Pro

* My overall favorite of the American big three
* Good all-around rigs, interior, maintenance cost, powerplant are all really good, not great. 
* Pretty damn tough, my old fords are still taking a beating 
* Big comfortable back seats

Con

* The used market is mediocre for them 
* The ride can be rough, especially on the older leaf-sprung rigs

&amp;#x200B;

Nissan

Pro

* Really does feel like a no-name Toyota. Almost as good but not  
* Cheap to buy 
* Tough interiors, I could probably pressure wash the damn thing inside

Con

* Seriously lagging behind on creature comforts even in the new higher trim packages 
* Very plastic feeling interiors 

&amp;#x200B;

Dodge

Pro

* Pretty decent ride offroad
* Tough exteriors

Con

* Expensive parts 
* Atrocious interiors in older models. You glance at the dash and it'll crack. 
* Shitty paint

I recently changed the spark plugs on my 99 Chevy S10 with the 4.3L V6. After changing the plugs, I still had a problem where the engine will drop in RPM's when starting up cold, and start perfectly when warm. This happened before changing the spark plugs.

What could be causing this? I'll add that when taking the wire off of the PITA plug, aka plug #3, the wire stem broke off.

"Hi

My car has broken and I will probably need to get one. I had a Peugeot 206, so quite a small car. The trunk was a bit tight but my german shepherd fit; altought I would ideally prefer a big bigger trunk or a model that has a 'straight' trunk so the dog has more space. Some years ago there was a trend of small cars with a 'vertical/square' trunk and of course they leave more room for the dogs to look outside of the window. Like the Renault Modus. But it does seem to have pass and now more small carsa have rounded trunks again.

I taught my second dog to ride in the seats, as they do not fit together in my trunk. But I do not think that I can train them to travel in the seats together without playing so I am afraid that thats not an option.

I was hoping that some of you dog parents would have good insight in models that are good for travelling with dogs. I am in Europe if that is relevant (idk).

"So I’ve been having car troubles for months now, primarily centered around the evap system.

The latest goes as such: I have two codes, p0443 (Purge valve circuit) and p0496 (high evap flow)

I also started having a noise only during acceleration, though not when parked and giving it gas. Another issue was after getting gas, my car wouldn’t want to start.

I replaced the purge valve because it was suggested by everyone I talked to, and that fixed the starting issue, but my engine light came back on, and boom, same codes. 

Tonight I checked the wiring. Getting voltage on the red wire, and I have continuity between the purge valve and ECM on the ground wire, so I know there’s no open wires. When I disconnected the harness from the ECM to check the ground wire, that wire was no longer grounded, so I also know it wasn’t grounding elsewhere, unless it was to another wire in the harness which was disconnected.

Would my next step be replacing the ECM? I know the p0443 code is for a circuit, but is there a way it could be something else?",The mysterious p0443 code…,1.0,cars,YAMS_Chief,True

In Australia, we don't have any concrete date for deliveries or arrivals for test cars, or a final price. I'm hoping it comes in cheaper than the Supra.  To say I am excited is an understatement.

"Hi guys - I need some help removing mould from my car please.

[Photos Here](https://imgur.com/a/JReZIDr)

I drive my work van 99% of the time as the company allows me to use it for personal reasons. That means that my old '96 Civic has been parked in the office car park for a good 3/4 months now. I usually pop and check on it every week or two, but due to the holidays etc I hadn't checked on it for nearly a month, and so I'm hoping I caught this somewhat early.

I have read that an ozone generator will be helpful, and a white vinegar/water mixture in a spray bottle should get rid of most of the mould short term. As for the long-term, I have cleaned all the water bottles and other crap out of my car, and also noticed that the inside of the sunroof had water droplets on, so I have wiped that dry. Do you guys think any more will be needed? Perhaps a steam clean? I think the very cold then humid weather we have had has done this, along with the various bottles etc that were left in there.

For the record, this is the first car I bought all by myself and has huge sentimental value for other reasons so feel awful for letting it get to this point. TIA for all/any help",Need advice on removing mould from my '96 Civic interior,1.0,cars,archiedotwav,True

"I took out the air box and the piping and MAF for my car recently to do some basic work. I checked out the insides of the air box and piping intently. Then, the air box is piping is connect to the next pipe with an accordion ""elbow"". I noticed that there was some waffle weaves on some sections of the walls of the airbox itself but the plastic was generally smooth. 

Then, there were two plastic fins near the opening of the main tube and then the MAF sensor. In this section of the tube, the pipe was smooth. However, the pipe is noticeably rougher just past the MAF. The textures differ like how the skin of an apple compares to the peel of an orange. 

I get that the waffle weaves and the fins were there to straighten the air flow and possibly baffle some noise. 

Why is the section of the tubing past the MAF rough? Why is the section upstream the MAF really smooth (aside from the air straightening elements)? 

Won't it be better to be smooth for better air flow? 

Why did they use an accordion elbow that is definitely not smooth and will alter the laminar flow? 

What is the benefit of having turbulent flow this far upstream from the intake manifold? Even with a turbocharged car like mine, my instincts tell me that smoother flow can only be beneficial and be easier for the turbo to work.

" If this is the wrong sub for this question just let me know.

I  am vaguely considering using an oxygen concentrator off ebay to increase the oxygen in the intake air on my car from 21% to somewhere around 25%, this  should give me a decent 18%ish power boost and would be similar to a  25-shot of nitrous on my celica. I should be able to use the  concentrator to pressurize a 2L holding tank to 5psi or so, which should  give me 10 seconds of enriching the intake air to 25% since the car only has like a 1.8L engine. I have done a lot of searching online and can't  find any information on how dangerous this would be to my engine  (everyone I find is just shooting a massive jet of oxygen into the  intake and the engine blows up pretty quick). I know nitrous would do a  better job at this, but I am sorta interested to see if this is possible.

Is engine brake ""size"" dictated by torque or by hp? I know hp=torque x rpm/5252, etc.

Every time I need/want to ""engine brake"", I just use a lower gear (at lower rpm if possible) and try to use the engine's reluctance to increase those rpm as ""braking force"". 

I will always go with the car with higher torque at lower rpm. But someone argued that engine brake ""size"" is given not by torque but by hp?!",Engine brake - Torque vs bhp,1.0,cars,Floxinolon,True

"Hi, I'm Dave VanderWerp, testing director for Car and Driver and one of the drivers at our annual Lightning Lap track test. Every year we put the hottest new performance cars through the ultimate  test: lapping Virginia International Raceway's 4.1-mile Grand Course, the toughest track in the U.S. 

This year was notable for a few reasons: first, it marks Lighting Lap's 15th year, and this year's crop of cars set a number of new records: fastest four door (Porsche Panamera Turbo S), front driver (Honda Civic Type R LE), under-$65k LL2 category (Ford Mustang Mach 1), and SUV (Porsche Cayenne Turbo GT).  

We've lapped 298 production vehicles over 15 events, adding 21 new times this year with cars like the Porsche 911 GT3, Merdedes-AMG GT Black Series, Subaru BRZ/Toyota GR86, VW GTI and Golf R, Cadillac CT4-V and CT5-V Blackwings, and BMW M3. The full results, stories, and videos from this year's event can be found at [https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a38955362/lightning-lap-2022/](https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a38955362/lightning-lap-2022/).

I'm joined by the other drivers from this year's event: K.C. Colwell ([u/A2KC](https://www.reddit.com/u/A2KC/)), Dave Beard ([u/nameonface](https://www.reddit.com/u/nameonface/)), Tony Quiroga, and Rich Ceppos.

I got breakdown to come out and check my car and they found no error code in their system for my car, so he was a bit puzzled on what it could be. The only thing he saw was that the black connector on the battery was a little loose so he tightened it.

"This engineering mystery continues to baffle me, and every time I think about it I come to the conclusion that I must just be stupid so I'm hoping you guys can explain.

Going all the way back to the MP4-12C, McLaren has been putting open differentials in their car. There have been numerous articles over the years about how they use a very sophisticated torque vectoring system to simulate the efforts of an LSD including on their P1 hypercar which is supposedly the only application of the system Chris Harris likes. 

I removed the link from a blacklisted domain, but here's the quote: 

&gt;“If we have a limited-slip different or an e-diff, we add weight,” he said. So, the solution is to not add one at all, and rely instead on torque vectoring by braking. “What the brakes do is grab the inside wheel to help the car rotate. Because you’re using components already there, you’re not adding any extra weight,” he added.   

Ok, so they don't want to add weight. Makes sense that they would worship at the altar of Chapman, and speaking of Lotus, they also don't always recommend that customers option one: 

http://www.sandsmuseum.com/cars/elise/information/misc/nick/  

&gt;The Elise was always designed from the outset to work without an LSD. We have recently started to offer an LSD as an option on the Toyota engined cars, primarily in response to market demand from the Autocross enthusists in the USA, who need one to be competitive when accelerating away at full throttle from very slow, tight corners in first or second gear.

&gt;In this type of competition they do not tend to run high speed (100mph +) corners and therefore the increase in understeer on this type of corner which you get with an LSD is of little negative consequence to them and they therefore are better off with an LSD.

&gt;In our experience an Elise or Exige equipped with an LSD is at a disadvantage to one without an LSD on a typical European race track. On top of that the LSD bluntens the steering feel and response of the car which we don't like.  

So according to Lotus engineers, LSDs can hurt performance at high speed cornering maneuvers, primarily under-steer at initial turn-in.  

Ok, so I'm reading this stuff and putting together that McLaren doesn't bother with LSDs because it adds weight and induces unwanted cornering characteristics at high speeds. So naturally it makes sense that their high performance supercars, which their owns will track a lot more than the average joe will not want these downsides, right?  

Ok...so then why the hell do they put LSDs on all their GT3 cars which are specifically obessed with high speed racing and weight reduction at all costs? They've been doing it since the MP4-12C GT3 and all the way up to the 720S GT3.

So now I'm officially confused. Do they not put an LSD in their road cars because it's overkill? If that's the case, why does shit as cheap as the Mustang and Miata offer it, at least as an option?  

Do they do it to save weight? The savings between an LSD and open diff seem to be a dozen pounds at best from what I've been able to find online.  

Are they doing it as cost cutting? It seems insane that this would be the reason. These are six figure cars, with some having million dollar price tags.  

The best I can come up with is that they slap the LSD on because they can fine-tune it better than their torque vectoring system for each track they race on, but when everyone from Mustangs to Ferraris to Formula 1 use an LSD solution for their cars, I just can't accept that as the reason.","McLaren uses open diffs in their road cars because they say their torque vectoring tech is just as good, but then put LSDs in their GT3 cars.

Research the specific car model (year, make, model) find out the common problems it’s has. Also research when the cars starts to have issues around a certain mileage point.

Get the cars vin number and pull the maintenance records. Once you get the maintenance records cross reference it with the owners manual and see if the car have been maintained and check at the given time that was provided in the owners manual.

Then after that inspect the car in person check oils, suspension, check for leaks, and misaligned parts on the car, test drive it, and etc.

"I know it's a ridiculous idea given that Ford has given up the idea of any other performance vehicles other than the Mustang, and then they would never want to infringe on the sales of the Mustang, but I can't help but think they have a good basis.

Hi guys so I was trying to change my rear pads today and I found my caliper bolts harder than usual to take off. I eventually had to get out my breaker bar and to my dismay the bolts gave way and snapped in the middle. I'm now stuck with the bottom end of the bolts still in the caliper. The top end of the bolt appears to have red Loctite on the threads. Iv never used Loctite on my caliper bolts however I did send my car to the mechanic a few months ago to get my rear rotors machined. As far as I'm aware red Loctite is very unnecessary on caliper bolts and has possibly caused my issue today.

"I know it's all about opinion, and that's all I'm asking for here. I had planned to get a 370z during this summer but my G has given out and need a new car. I could get a Z but I'm not trying to buy one with 130k+ on it like it did with the G (152k). And there's very few Z's to choose from, whereas there's plenty of options for the FT86 bros. I drove my friends 370z like twice (stick) so I wasn't really able to open her up as I'm still new to stick and it wasn't my car. I've never owned stick but I've always wanted one. I've driven that Z, a Mazda 2, and a VW Rabbit (each only once for like 20 mins) and while I don't think I'll have too much trouble learning stick, it's more about is it ideal. But it's a sports car so you've gotta get a stick right lmao. 

I have 2 options. Get a FT86 and drive that for 2-3 years, or drive my sister's Civic for a 8-12 months and hopefully be able to get a 370z that's stick w under 100k miles for under 20k. Does that sound plausible? 

The more I read on about the 86 v Z debate it seems like the only edge the Z has is the power. I don't plan to do much to the FT if it get it, probably a CAI and maybe an aftermarket muffler but that's it. However, simply by asking ""am I going to be disappointed"" says a lot.

"I finally got into stick shifts last summer after more than 15 years of driving automatics. I bought an old GTI and drove it around to practice. I loved shifting gears, learning to hill-toe downshift, riding in the backroads, learning how to fix cars, it was wonderful.


And then I got stuck in traffic uphill for a few hours. That was horrendous, my foot got super tired and the stress of the car rolling back or just engaging/disengaging hand brakes constantly was too much for me. I live in Vancouver, BC, and boy we do have a lot of traffic AND steep hills here. It definitely discouraged me from taking the car out when it was busy. So I ended up not driving my GTI for awhile unless I could go out at night or going against traffic to the countrysides. 


I have a comfy modern SUV as a daily car, but I want to drive something that's more engaging in the weekends, going on dates with my wife, driving to the mountains, etc. The thing is, weekends here suck with traffic so I'm in a conundrum. I've thought of PDK/DCT cars, but there aren't too many of them to begin with outside of Porsche/VW/Audi. And it's just not the same for me from actual manual transmissions.

"Howdy boys

I bought an FRS last month, and I love it so much. It’s the fastest car I’ve owned. I went to a car show recently, and met a gt3 owner. We hit it off and he took me for a ride in his gt3, and to my surprise let me drive it. Here’s my thoughts.

The engine is amazing, revving to 9k rpm is awesome, it’s sounds like a monster. That being said, there’s something about my FRS that this porsche, so I was disappointed.

Handling is great, the steering feel is great. The alcantara is great on the steering wheel, too. I drove it on a small twisty and it felt good coming out of corners. It didn’t feel quite as good as my small frs on turn in, and I felt like it was missing something that my frs had so I was disappointed, it just wasn’t the same. Maybe porsche should take some notes off the frs.

Overall, the gt3 is a great car but I couldn’t justify trading in my frs for one. Considering how desirable the frs is, I feel like I truly have something special.

"So im not really to knowledgeable on cars and such and want to ask a few questions, if someone can help me and correct me if needed thatd be great.

So I just got a 2004 bmw 325ci and for my first upgrade I want it to sound mean. So i tried to do my research and came to the conclusion that I would need these couple things?

[and maybe this?](https://www.ecstuning.com/b-supersprint-parts/supersprint-performance-muffler-oval-tips/787407~ssp/)

Do I have all the correct things to make my car sound mean? Are all the parts selected compatible so I can have them all installed at once? Is there better parts on the website I should replace with one? 

If thats the case i can get more expensive headers, or the pipe. And the exhaust to be a max of 800.

This will be over the course of a while and i wont be able to get it all at once, but please let me know if this is the stuff i need to reach my goal and also if i even have the right parts.

"I've read a few articles in which Porsche's head of sports cars Frank-Steffen Walliser where he discusses the implications for the 911 after 2026.

So you can't make a small engine and get it to make a large amount of horsepower through technical wizardry anymore, you'd have to make its displacement large enough to be allowed to have that horsepower.

Sounds simple enough, but wait. This law incentivizes BIGGER engines. Which burn more fuel. Which is worse for the environment. What? Why are they making this a thing? And also, given how you'd need a bigger engine to produce the desired HP, that should mean that turbocharging is essentially dead, since turbos are how a small engine makes tons of power. But in the interviews, Walliser says it's N/A engines that are doomed and turbos are the only way to go. That's the exact opposite of what the law would do, though, isn't it?

"Hello, I don’t know if this is the correct place to ask questions. If not please guide me to a different subreddit.

I have a 1992 Ford Taurus I have replaced the fuel tank and fuel pump myself twice and have taken it to two shops. I also replaced the fuel filter too. Every time I make a right turn my car just stalls/dies/shuts off. My fuel pump is on the right hand passenger side. Obviously, the right turn moves the fuel to the left because of the force. 

This event doesn’t happen when the car is full of fuel BUT when it does happen and I fuel up the car I only fuel up a half tank, 8 gallons. My fuel tank is 16 gallons. Just recently it has become worst. Every right turn, every time I break, and even when I’m switching lanes the car dies. I’m still able to start up the car though every time. This recent incident when I filled up my car I only put in 4 gallons of fuel toping it off too.

I have an opel Astra h form 2004 and I bought a radio that has in-built CarPlay and other things but it doesn’t show anything on the screen I been looking the manual of the radio and in the back it has a light that power one when you connect it so at least it receives electricity where I think the problem is at the key detection I’ve been looking some electronic diagrams online and my car has 2 wires for the key  one of them is positive and the other negative and the new radio only has one wire for key detection. It doesn’t turn on doesn’t matter if i put on positivo or negative the radio don’t turn on so my question is how I solve this? Is my car incompatible with this radio?

My question is what makes this different from the regular MT that I already know and understand? When I look up iMT online, I get conflicting answers. I have seen some sites that say that it is a manual without a clutch pedal, other sites state that it does use a clutch pedal, but it works somewhat differently than a standard MT, and yet other sites say it has a clutch pedal, but turning on the iMT removes the need to shift gears, except from N to 1st.

Now on a lot of cars the only way to get the assembly out is by removing the entire front bumper, or going through the wheel well.

looking to upgrade the rims on my 2011 Mondeo.

The car is an automatic Toyota Yaris 2011- it had passed an MOT 3 months ago with no faults or advisories even. Last serviced December 2020.

"My car started over heating back in September a day after I had my AC compressor recharged. That week I replaced the thermostat and water pump and bled the air out the system. It worked fine for a week until I took it to the freeway where it overheated again all I did was pour water in the radiator and it was fine up until November where it overheated again. After changing the thermostat again and bleeding the system it was fine but my reservoir tank would be empty or low on coolant and needed to be refilled and checked everyday, now it’s overheating again. I’ve bled the system twice now, took it out for a long drive with hot air coming out of the AC and it was fine, an hour later I drove it again and it overheated, with no hot air coming from the AC. I changed the radiator, filled the system and while attempting to bleed it the car overheated. However after turning the car off and filling the radiator with more water the car did not overheat but there was no hot air coming from the AC and the water pump hose was cold while the thermostat housing hose was hot. There is no white or blue smoke coming from the exhaust, there was never any white smoke under the hood, can’t find any noticeable leaks under the car or around the engine, oil is not milky neither is the radiator cap, and I see no bubbles from the reservoir or radiator.

I currently drive a Mercedes A250 and I feel like the controls are so overly complicated for no reason.

My A250 as the following Cruise Control buttons:
1. ON 
2. OFF

4. SET -

1. Why do we need an ON button, why is it not always on and simply activated on SET?
2. Same as #1 why would we need to STOP it?
3/4. The SETs are actually the only useful buttons, although why +/-? Why not just one button?
5. This is the next useful button since you can set to the previous ""set"" limit. It's practical but not necessary. 
6. Why this button since we can already stop the cruise control with the break pedal?

"Over the past year and a half I’ve been through 3 different vehicles: a 2007 Chevy Tahoe, a manual 2017 Golf GTI, and currently a 2022 Chevy Colorado.  All of these vehicles are phenomenal and good for different things, but I’ve definitely enjoyed the GTI the most by far.  

What I want is a vehicle that is practical for outdoor use, plenty of room inside the car to store stuff or even sleep, and also a fun daily driver with decent mpg.  The GTI was a phenomenal and incredibly fun daily with decent mpg and I LOVED the hatch but it was mediocre at best off the pavement.  The current truck I have is obviously great off road, which is why I wanted it, but it’s not as fun as the GTI, it’s not manual, I can’t put the rear seats down and camp out with the Girlfriend either haha. 

This brings me to the Outback/Crosstrek.  In terms of looks, I like the crosstrek a lot more but it’s also less room inside and not nearly as many trim options as the Outback.  

•Looking on Subarus website the Outback has SO MANY trims, which is the best all around? Do the trims with the higher HP/Torque turbocharged engine come with any disadvantages to the trims without the turbo? Are the turboed trims still as good off-road? 

•How is space in the Outback/crosstrek? I’m a 5’8” guy and I had just enough room to completely stretch out in the GTI.  I’d want that much space at least in both of these cars.

"In September 2021, I flew out from SoCal to a city in NorCal to buy a 2011 Lotus Elise R. I had a one-way flight, so I was dead set on driving the Elise back home.

My flight almost didn’t happen. The seller was attending a wedding that night and wasn’t sure if he felt comfortable bringing the Lotus out. That weekend was going to be my only night off for weeks, so I convinced him it had to be done.

When I got to the airport, the parking I paid for in advance was completely full. They refunded my money, but I was worried! My flight was about to board in 15 minutes!!!

I found a hotel next door that did valet parking. I don’t remember the price they charged for overnight parking, but I do remember thinking “oh, wow! That’s expensive!” I didn’t have much of a choice, though.

I got a shuttle ride to LAX and made it just as the final few passengers were boarding.

I won’t bore you with details about the flight. Nothing of interest happened.

I got a Lyft ride to the wedding location, but the Lotus seller wasn’t there. He texted saying he was “a few minutes away,” but he ended up showing up at least half an hour later. In the meantime, I looked like an under-dressed weirdo standing outside the wedding event.

Man, when I saw the Lotus… Wow…

I heard it before I saw it. It is so *loud*! It has an Arqay dual exhaust and Inokinetic decat.

It’s such a beautiful car! I loved it as soon as I laid eyes on it for the first time. Pictures didn’t do it enough justice.

My drive back home was interesting as hell. I left around 6:45 pm after signing paperwork with the previous owner and handing him the check + some cash.

I had some dude in a Charger try to egg me on for a race for a good 2-3 miles, and when I wouldn’t bite, even gesturing to the guy to go away, he got in front of me and brake checked me. 🙄

My first stop at a gas station included an older gentleman approaching me and talking about the Elige’s. He was super knowledgeable about them. I was pleasantly surprised. He said he would’ve loved to own one, but he has kids. I said I have one kid. He pointed at a Honda Odyssey with a full family inside a few gas pumps away and we both just laughed.

Various people took pictures of my Elise as I went through a desert.

I took plenty of breaks because although the car wasn’t too uncomfortable, my legs got tired.

At another gas station, my driver side door wouldn’t unlock. I had a box with the stock suspension in the passenger seat, so I couldn’t climb over and get out that way.

It just so happened that a van pulled up next to me. At least a dozen (mostly intoxicated) people hopped out and began ogling my Lotus. Somebody asked me what kind of Ferrari it was. I said, “It’s a Lotus Elise.” He said, “Oh, I’ve never heard of that one before. These Ferraris are rare!”

I ended up asking one of the guys if he could try to open the door from the outside. It didn’t work.

I was embarrassed, but most of them seemed too drunk to realize I was stuck.

I eventually managed to open my door. After filling up the gas tank, I left before the vanpool came back from getting their snacks and whatever else they were getting inside the gas station’s store. Sometimes I still wonder if that guy who tried to help me ever thinks about that night and laughs at himself that a “FeRaRi OwNeR” was briefly trapped.

As the night went on, I began feeling drowsy. I had been on the road for more than 8 hrs (with various stops, of course). The multiple energy drinks I had been chugging weren’t helping at all.

As I was driving past Six Flags Magic Mountain, I nearly fell asleep at the wheel. I immediately got off the highway and checked 3 different hotels. All booked.

I called a handful of other hotels. All booked.

Did I mention it was Labor Day weekend? Oof!

I pulled into a parking lot adjacent to Six Flags and just slept in the Lotus. It wasn’t the most comfortable nap, but I felt energized and ready to continue my drive home.

I made it home at 9 am. That was a 15-hour journey in the Elise! Lord have mercy on my body.

One of my cousins, who owns a Lotus Evora, showed up around 10 am to both check out the car &amp; give me a ride to the airport so I could pick up my daily driver (Toyota 86) that I had left in a paid parking lot.

With limited sleep, I made the trip back to my house in nightmare fuel stop &amp; go Los Angeles traffic.

The car has been amazing ever since. I got an oil change done back in December. A Lotus shop (some of you may know it: Inokinetic) told me the gearbox needs a cable changed. They quoted me $1600. I’ll get it done soon enough.

My driver side headlight bulb burnt out. I intend to replace it myself. I just need to find time and put in the effort.

Besides that, the car has been terrific. It’s truly a pleasure to drive. It gets a decent amount of attention, mostly from people wanting to know what it is. I occasionally catch people taking pictures of the Lotus, too.

"I drive a 2015 MK6 1.8tsi “stage 2 tuned” with boltons and I am looking at a 2001 MK4 1.8t jetta with a 2015 beetle manual transmission. So for some backstory:

It’s actually a car I am planning on getting. Owner said the car drove fine (MK4 jetta 1.8t big turbo built engine with a 2015 beetle transmission and a stage 3 clutch). Said one day the pedal started randomly sticking when he pushed it down and sometimes wouldn’t come up. Eventually it just wouldn’t come up anymore and he parked it up for good. 

We came to see the car and it still turned over, he said he didn’t even try to pull back the clutch pedal before we came as it just recently happened and he wanted to explain that before he sold it to anyone and didn’t want to touch anything else. He thought he could’ve burned the clutch as it makes heavy power and is hard to catch traction even in later gears so he figured he damaged it but it seems fine.

So we came there, lifted the clutch pedal back into place easily, pushed it in and it basically goes between snapping closed and staying in that position or snapping open, theres no hydraulic fluid/pressure when engaging or disengaging. Checked the clutch fluid reservoir and its full to the top as it should be. Checked everything behind the panels where the clutch pedal is and everything was screwed into place and torqued properly save for a loose clutch bracket nut.

Pretty sure the fluid likely isn’t leaking if its still full and hopefully lines are all okay but then we have to assume its the master or slave cylinders. It’s not too expensive or difficult a fix but I want to get rid of my daily car (MK6 jetta) and get this beast but without seeing it DRIVE its hard to justify even though we could turn over the engine and rev it fine etc, coast in neutral, stalls when put in gear. Current owner said a big reason he’s selling it is because he doesn’t want to spend any more time or money in the car (older guy) and though he has a bigger turbo kit for it he decided he’d sell it and the turbo kit and get a good amount of money for it, the reason I say this is because it means he is unwilling to repair it or pay for repairs and said if he did, he’d just end up continuing with owning it.

I really want to get it and do the quick work and while I trust the owner its hard to justify getting a car you’ve never seen drive. Especially considering I will need it driving within the week I get it.

Three years in review:

As someone that has a lot of seat time in a wide variety of supercars, the 4C gives you a level of engagement only the most track focused cars can surpass. It sounds like a tuner car from the factory, with all the right turbo sounds to make you feel like a kid again every time you boost, and has the looks to match with its beautiful lines front to rear.

It’s exceptionally visceral to drive and feels completely at home in the Malibu canyons here in SoCal where I spent most of my spirited driving. I ended up putting 25,000 miles on the car over the near three years I had the car from new.

The car wasn’t all that perfect, and I was well experienced in its flaws. The car had very light on center steering, terrible tram lining and an extremely light front end during high speed cornering.I never could get full confidence in the car on the faster roads during cornering as a result. Keep in mind I kept the car completely stock aside from the wheels. There are aftermarket solutions for many of these issues.

The suspension was, obviously, terribly stiff even without the race suspension and the road noise was extreme to say the least (the only thing between your seat and the road was the bare carbon tub). I did take it on a handful of roadtrips throughout my ownership despite all this and it was overall manageable. 

Why I sold:

I just picked up a new job that was no longer permanently WFH. I had sold my 500Abarth when covid hit since I didn’t need a daily anymore so I needed something that would be able to traverse the notorious 405 freeway traffic far more comfortably than the 4C ever could now that I had to go into work a couple days a week. Also, I bought the car for $55k new and was able to get out of the car for ~$63k nearly three years and 25k free miles later.

The F Type:

I was looking for something around the same price point that matched the 4C in the one category I really cared about the most: Fun. I don’t really care about what car is the fastest for the money or has the best lap times etc.

I really only look for fun factor and smiles per gallon when making car purchase. Second and third to fun for me are looks and sound so my standards were pretty straightforward.

I watched started researching reviews for cars in this price point and when the F type came up almost every review I watched commented on how much fun the car was to drive. It also happened to check off my other two requirements extremely well too, so after a quick test drive here I am!

I’ve had the car for a bit over a month now and have zero regrets. It’s a completely different driving experience from the 4C in a more intoxicating-supercharged-V8-with-over-double-the-horsepower-and-Zeus’s-thunder-in-the-exhaust kind of way.

"I always wanted a coupe, I currently drive a rebuilt title Cadillac XT5, which has had some issues, so I want a stable and reliable vehicle.

"**Article from November 2021**

https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/rcmp-decommssioned-vehicles-resale-1.6249378

&gt; Lucki suggested a phased-in approach to reducing the backlog of surplus vehicles. Phase one is what the RCMP is doing now: leasing temporary storage space and crushing decommissioned vehicles that have been involved in accidents or no longer work — vehicles the RCMP says have low resale values.

&gt; Phase two would permit the police service to sell off-road vehicles. Phase three would allow sales of on-road vehicles, such as Dodge Caravans and Toyota Camrys.

&gt; In her briefing note, Lucki insists phase three sales would not include vehicles the public would recognize as police cars, such as Dodge Chargers or Ford Explorers. The RCMP is undergoing an internal and external review to decide how to handle those vehicles.

This is a classic example of outrage that results in actions taken that *seem* to be helping but are actually stupid and do nothing of use. 

The 2020 Nova Scotia shooter used a retired Ford Taurus Police Interceptor that can be found at any government auction across the US and Canada. Somehow, he had it outfitted with RCMP police decals. Rather than take action against the vinyl decal industry and ensure that police decals aren't made or installed on fake police cars, what do they do? Ban Ford Taurus sales...

What idiots. There are tons of civilian Ford Tauruses, Explorers, and Dodge Chargers out there that are white and could be outfitted with fake police decals. Yes, there are minor differences in the grill and tail lights and most have steel wheels etc, but the general public would not notice that. If someone wanted a fake police car, all it takes is a white car with decals and that's it. Do you think 50 year old grandmas are going to be able to tell ""oh yeah, this Ford Taurus has LED tail lights rather than the incandescent assemblies found on the police models. This guy is a phony""?

And for Canadian car enthusiasts who don't want to impersonate cops, kiss goodbye the great deals you could find at government auctions. Ford Taurus 3.5L twin turbo V6 AWD sedan for cheap? Gone. Ford Explorer SUV for your growing family that can't afford new prices? Gone. Dodge Charger V8 AWD sedan that was only sold to police in the new generation? Gone. These awesome, fun, cheap, iconic American cars could very well be heading to the crusher to be wasted away. This is even worse than Cash for Clunkers in America, yeah we destroyed the engines of a bunch of good running cars, but the chassis at least went to the junkyards for the rest of the parts.

Unfortunately when people die, the grieving families are given a megaphone as if they're legislators and whatever dumb idea they have is then the direction everyone has to go to fix the issue, no matter how pointless it is. We have the same problem in America with non-automotive related issues. You could probably guess.

Canadians, enjoy your higher tax rates so you can feel safer. If the RCMP doesn't get back to selling their retired cop cars, the next logical choice is they sell them for peanuts to the scrap yards and the taxpayers foot the bill that would have otherwise been covered by the auction.","After 1 year, Canada's federal police (RCMP) still refusing to auction decommissioned Ford Taurus, Explorer, and Dodge Charger police cruisers after gun massacre, in order to prevent impersonation police cars",1.0,cars,refrigerator_runner,True

"Somewhere down the line, I *may* have the opportunity to purchase a clean, straight 2003 or '04 Dodge Ram 2500 single cab 6.7 Cummins / 6-speed from a friend of a friend.

He's quickly liquidating all his property and assets, and turning them into cash, to pay for his hospice care and medical treatments, as well as make the estate process easier for his grown kids. He's expressed an interest in selling the truck not only because he wants the money, but also because he's simply getting too tired and weak to herd that big beast around anymore.

"Today, I brought home this new 2022 RF Grand Touring to go alongside the ‘19 F-150 5.0. I’ve absolutely fallen in love with this car. 

Of all the cars I’ve owned—from a 2020 Mustang GT 6MT to a Focus ST to a Scat Pack Challenger to an NC Miata to a ZL1 and more—this is by far and away the greatest. This past summer, I had the opportunity to drive a Huracan for 8 laps at a local track… and I can still safely say that ND RF is the best and, most importantly, most fun car I’ve ever driven. 

It sounds ridiculous. That’s a ludicrous statement (on its face). I thought it was ridiculous when I came back from the test drive. Thinking that this car would beat everything else I was considering for a weekend driver—including a Jaguar F-Type, C8, and the GR Supra. I also test drove the new BRZ and GR86 and was *slightly* underwhelmed. 

But it did it. The ND RF beat out cars twice its price. Easily. 

I honestly didn’t really consider the ND and was very close to purchasing a C8. I owned an NC and enjoyed it but didn’t love it. I liked it a lot. But then I drove past the Mazda dealership on the way to Chevrolet and saw this beauty. I figured, “Why the hell not? I’ve always wanted to drive an ND and I have time to kill.”

Two days later, I bought the car.

There is something about this car that feels wholly special. Perfect and precise always. It feels like witchcraft, and the sensation of rowing through this gearbox is a religious experience—I say this only partially in jest.

I’m happy to be here, and I’m loving the car.

I’m worried that the Camry will feel weaker than my old Accord.

Does the electric motor in the Camry really compensate for the difference in hp? (275 hp in my old Accord vs 212 hp in new Camry SL).

"I am not new to VWAG products. I have leased a 2009 A4, a 2011 A4 Quattro, a 2012 A6 3.0T Quattro, a 2016 GTI S and a 2018 GTI SE. In between the A6 and the GTI I also had a 2013 TL for a short period of time and a 2014 328i M-Sport. I am very versed in new German cars.

All that said, the Arteon is closest to the A6 in most ways. It is FWD rather than AWD, and has a smaller and less powerful engine, but it is a similar size and similar levels of luxury and tech for their time(minus the lack of real wood trim in the Arteon). The seats are soft Nappa leather in a beautiful 2 tone Raven/Stone. The MIB 3 system is a little slow to start up, but once it is running, it is amazing. I have wireless charging for my phone, wireless Carplay, a great Nav system that is usable thru the main LCD instrument panel and a familiar interface. Both LCD screens are clear and bright.

Other nice little things inside include a large, thick rimmed steering wheel that feels expensive(including the capacitive touch buttons, which work much better than I expect), power seats with 3 memory selection, and great looking ambient lighting that can be lit in a variety of colors. I switch between red, blue and mint green usually. The back seat is huge, pretty much limo like, although head room is a bit tight. Not an issue for me as the person most likely to sit back there is my adult daughter, and she is short. The hatch is nearly twice the size of the GTI.

Speaking of the GTI, the Arteon is a tiny bit slower, and the Aisen 8 speed transmission is slower to shift than my old DSG. The engine is a EA888 2.0T with an IS38 turbo, putting out 268hp and 256lb-ft. The missing eVAQ LSD is barely noticeable. The unmodified car is not going to win many races, but is more than enough for street driving and chewing up highway miles. The car has VW’s newest version of DCC, and Comfort mode is nice and a bit floaty, while Sport mode tightens things up noticeably. The car also feature ACC and active lane keeping, which combine to form level 1.5 autonomous driving. This feature is great for long trips like the one we took from Vegas to Hollywood this Christmas.

As far as the exterior goes, I think the car is extremely attractive, tho the 19” wheels that came on my mid-level SEL R-Line model are a bit weird looking. The big fastback hatch looks low and wide, and the big open grille looks aggressive while not looking ridiculous. The doors are frameless and have “VW Logo” shaped puddle lights. My car is in a beautiful Lapiz Blue, a color shared with the Golf R.

Overall, I am VERY happy with my Arteon, and cannot recommend it enough. It feels like an Audi without the price tag and the badge.

I want the vehicle to get decent fuel mileage, the best I can squeeze out of it, and have enough space to haul my projects, whether that's 2x4's or tools or a new toy.

Only thing is I don't know where to even start. What engine can I get my hands on that would get the efficiency I want.

3. If you already have LSD, why do you still need TC? Shouldn't LSD work better than TC?
4. As an Audi owner, does it mean they changed from LSD to LD when they got rid of Torsen?

* Using tow hitch as a hammer (too unwieldy and short)
* Kicking the back side of it a bit (can't get an effective angle, and too worried about hitting the jack)

"For those who are unaware or have forgotten, ""cash for clunkers"" was officially the Car Allowance Rebate System (CARS), a 2009 $3 billion U.S. federal scrappage program intended to provide economic incentives to U.S. residents to purchase a new, more fuel-efficient vehicle when trading in a less fuel-efficient vehicle. \[[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_Allowance_Rebate_System)\] 

The wiki link article addresses major points of the program, such as its *effects on car sales*, *effects on the economy*, and *effects on vehicle emissions*. Of a particular interest to me is the question of ""did it create sales or did it just move sales that would've happened after the program to *during the program period?*

100 cars @ 50’000 = 5’000’000

"I recently bought my first car with auto start/stop. I've encountered it a couple times in the past on test drives and I've always immediately disabled it and hated it when I forgot to.

This particular car has no way to disable the system. You either need an ECU tune to permanently turn it off, or a defeat device installed. So I've been living with the system until I decided what route I wanted to take to defeat it. I've had a lot of bad experiences with modifying cars so I wanted to take my time on the decision. 

It turns out... it's actually really nice! If you have the radio/AC off and you're stuck at a long red light in traffic it's blissful silence. No engine vibrations, idling noise, just peace. It's a nice teaser of that EV ""traffic zen"" people talk about. It makes me excited for when an EV becomes practical for my life.

The system is easy to manipulate. It won't auto stop if you're in manual mode, so a light bump of the shifter disables it if you expect to need a swift takeoff shortly after stopping (bonus getting to hold the gear and ride the boost wave instead of ""D"" short shifting). I've had 6 manuals and only stopped buying them because of left ankle problems, so having to touch the shifter isn't a bothersome concept. Just need to pump the brakes lightly if you want it to leave autostop prematurely. 

Give the system a try if you have it and always disabled it from the start. You paid for beefed up parts built to handle frequent starts. See if it makes your drive more pleasant. As a bonus you save a smidge on fuel and pollute a little less.",I hated auto start/stop until I bought a car with it.,1.0,cars,cylindricalracoon,True

"My husband I bought subject Rogue. We purchased from CarMax with a warranty. Needless to say we  encountered transmission issues before manufacture warranty of 60k. CarMax 3rd party warranty refused to cover it. Nissan did some shady patch job and we were able to get over 60k mileage without further issue. Well now our transmission definitely needs replacement. CarMax refused claiming Nissan needs to cover. Nissan has had our car for 3 weeks and told us they would give us a discount stated 3k. 

Husband got the car back “fixed” and it’s screeching loudly. This whole thing has been an expensive nightmare. We both have to commute and have 2 young kids.

He disagreed with calling it a suicide door and said the term is specifically reserved for Rolls Royce's or Lincoln Continentals or cars of that stature in the car community and car culture. His premise was that the access doors on half cab trucks or doors on the RX-8 are not considered ""proper"" suicide doors.

So I got an email quote of 350-500 for the work I requested from a local shop.


The work was: creating the midpipe from the two exhaust manifold flanges to the resonators (underlined yellow). 
I won't have them put the secondary cat, so it'll just be pipes connected to the resonator.
The pipe section which I want made is highlighted in blue.

I'm going in for a formal quote Friday.
What should I expect? What is reasonable/unreasonable?

So something I always hear about is once you get a car, you begin to want the next one, then after that and so on.

So my question is how do you do it? Obviously my first thought is pay the rest of what I owe (around half), then begin the search all over again.

Last week I got word of a Falcon Sprint restoration that had gone stale around 5 years ago and the poor thing has just been on life support since.

I started tearing into it on Monday to start making a checklist of “to-do’s” and it’s a litany to say the least. 

The bad:

Wiring, complete interior, hoses, belts, gauges, handles, suspension bushings throughout, and assorted rusty hardware are the things that need the most attention that I can recall.

The good:

The body is super clean (no rust) and has a fairly fresh coat of paint, the motor is basically a new small block and the trans is newer as well. I still have to inspect the rear end but all accounts suggest it’s in good shape as well.

I’m prepared for the 2-3x price expectation tax on first builds but the abundant information I’ve come across so far has me confidently motivated.

With that said, can any of you lovely folks point to resources that would be of value in doing such a restoration? I’m guessing wiring diagrams, exploded interior/exterior part diagrams, or any other sources of wisdom would be greatly appreciated.

The lawsuit claims that because of the damage to the car, and possibly because who conducted the repairs, the car's ""branding and certification status"" have been compromised, and that the vehicle ""cannot be certified by Aston Martin and [the Plaintiff] is unable to have additional repairs or maintenance performed at any Aston Martin dealership.""

Can anyone here help explain this to me? I read a few articles online, and looked through the Aston Martin website. I see that Aston Martin does provide a sort of provenance certification for their cars, but I don't see anything indicating that someone could be barred from having repairs done at an Aston martin dealership due to past damage and/or having gone to another repair shop beforehand. Also, when the lawsuit refers to the ""branding and certification"" being compromised, does not that refer to anything other than the value of the car has been decreased because of a prior accident, or is there some specific, official designation Aston Martin confers?

Car was dead at end of day. Jump started it fine and drove home (40 mins). Stopped at shop to grab some dinner and groceries. In shop for 20 minutes. Car dead again so had to jump start. 

Got home and stuck a multi meter on it. Voltage sits as 13.5v when at idle. When a/c turned on and kicked in voltage dropped to 6-7v then went back up to 13.5v. (Was a bit concerned this was so low). Switched off and the battery was still at 13.5v immediately after. Went to turn the key again and car was dead. Battery dropped to 2 (two)v immediately. Did not turn over. Only clicked. 

I am guessing it has just completely shat itself. (Not sure how old it is, but at least 3 years). 

Going to get a new battery tomorrow, but just concerned it could be something else due to how low the reading dropped.

"If you ever have some free time, I have an interesting experiment that you can try just about anywhere you travel.

Go to a parking lot in a local shopping center. It doesn’t matter which parking lot; any lot will do. What *does* matter is that a lot of traffic comes and goes from the area. Park your vehicle in a safe place with a lot of visibility. All you have to do is look around and take notice of the other vehicles surrounding you. What do you see? Specifically, pay attention to the *colors* of these vehicles. A pattern will begin to emerge.

The vast majority of all automobiles are painted either white, black, grey/silver, red, or blue.

When did the automobile industry replace creativity with conformity in their design process? As recently as two decades ago, it wasn’t uncommon to see vehicles painted some shade of orange or purple. Go back even further and look at the cars of the 1950s, ‘60s, and ‘70s; you’d have no difficulty seeing vehicles from this era painted various pastel and neon shades of green, plum, or yellow. Since the dawn of the new millennium, something has undoubtedly shifted. Besides cars looking more and more alike in their physical styling and general ergonomics, the color palette that manufacturers draw from has grown increasingly smaller.

The most widespread color simply has to be white, by far. *Yes, I know white isn’t a color in respect to color theory; I’m speaking in a general sense in relation to auto paint, though.* Could there be any more of a boring color than white on a vehicle? I doubt it. The next most common must be black, followed by silver/grey. I lump silver and grey together because they’re essentially the same color, just with varying degrees of metallic flake mixed into the application. Trailing at the bottom of the top five colors would be red and blue, the only two true colors in a list of the most frequently seen.

Beyond those five distinctions, any other color is rather uncommon to see on your average day. You may occasionally see a vehicle that’s green, or perhaps yellow. Sometimes you’ll see a car painted brown, which I can’t comprehend for the life of me. *Why would you want your car to look like feces?*

I performed my experiment at a local Walmart shopping center around 5PM on a weekday afternoon. I sat and watched the main entrance into the shopping center and took note of each car’s color that passed by. It was fairly busy, so I only spent roughly twenty-five minutes taking count. Here are my results:  

**Total Cars: 332** 

**White: 132** 

**Black: 93** 

**Grey/Silver: 88** 

**Red: 15** 

**Blue: 8** 

**Other: 2 (1 Orange, 1 Brown)**

As you can see, most modern vehicles are painted in one of only five colors. The oldest vehicle I noticed come by was a late ‘80s Nissan pickup (black) and the newest vehicle was a 2022 Ford Maverick (grey). The lone orange vehicle was a second-generation Dodge Neon and the only brown car was a late-model Jeep Cherokee.

What does this say about the American automobile consumer? Are we devoid of originality in our buying habits? Or, is this a reflection on the auto industry failing to deliver more variety in their offerings? I’ve taken note of this dilemma for many years, especially on long highway trips where I can absorb the colors and types of vehicles driving around me. Once you see the blatant lack of color diversity, it becomes hard *not* to take notice of the problem everywhere you look.

About seven years ago, I was shopping for a new vehicle. I had a conversation with a local dealer about shipping in an orange Jeep from another dealer roughly 400 miles away. He refused to do so, stating that “orange vehicles don’t sell” and that he “has a hard time reselling anything orange.” I didn’t believe him then and I’m not so sure I believe him now. I simply refuse to accept that the American public only desires vehicles offered in five mundane colors.

"My work Van is an automatic (dialogic) and produces 200nm at 2500rpm. 
The manual version of this van produces 290nm at the same rpm. 
Clearly, the automatic version has been restricted to save the gearbox, which I discovered has a torque limit of 206nm. 
Because other people in the family also have to drive the van, the manual version wasn't an option. 
There is a number of tunes available that can bump the torque figure up to 250-300nm. 
My question is, does the gearbox always see the 200nm of torque at 2500rpm regardless of throttle position, or is maximum torque only there at WOT?
Basically, is 200nm of torque @ 2.5k RPM there at 20% throttle, or just at 100% throttle?

As in the title, a family member inadvertently put 18lt (4.7 gallons) off Gas into a Dieseel engine car. Before turning the engine on, following the suggestion of the gas station owner, he filled the rest (34lt, 9 gallons) of the tank with the Diesel, mixing the two. 

By reading online, i see that this method is only to be used in case of small quantities of gas. Now my question is: is that quantity of gas considerred a 'small quantity'?

"Hi guys. I no longer need my vehicle so I was looking into selling it as the market is pretty bonkers at the moment.

My Vehicle is a 2016 Ford Fusion SE with 81,000 miles on it. 
I bought it a few years ago after it was a rebuilt via hail damage. The CarMax history report confirms this and it was rebuilt and sold at an auction after the crazy hail storm. They replaced the front hood and a few side pieces and the hail is only evident on the top exterior frame of the car (essentially at the top of where the windows meet the roof). The car is in excellent mechanical condition, and looks great aesthetically as well. It is white so the hail dents that exist are hidden due to the color.

Of course, it just has the scary 'salvage' title to it.
I am going to privately sell it, but I am unsure what to price it at. KBB values my private sale at $13,980, but that of course assumes it has a clean title. Would selling it for say, $9,000 while fully disclosing the rebuilt title history be a fair price point? Or should I go lower?

My car is a 2010 Mazda 5 CR1 (gasoline) with 160'000km on the clock.

I already drove the car about 30km and did not notice any issues. Drives very smooth.

Should I remove oil? I'm not so much worried about the crank shaft - but I don't know about other effects like oil pressure.

"Hello,

Now this might sound like a silly basic question but…I’ve talked to colleagues repairing their own cars and even called the manufacturer of my car but no one can seem to tell me:

How do mechanics know how much Nm a bolt needs and what the OEM part number for a replacement part is?
Is their like a general database or so?

In videos or repair guides this is sometimes shown, but owning a car that isn’t like a tuning beloved E36 or something it’s often hard to find.
Also I’d like to have „official numbers“ just to make sure everything is right. I wouldn’t want to gamble about bolts not being tight enough on seatbelts or brakes for example.

Owning a seat Ibiza I only found an (quite expensive) official mechanic pdf regarding electronics; outlining all the wiring on roughly 1000 pages. But no luck finding a manual about mechanical parts.

I was perplexed that it had taken over a year to recognize this mishap but here we are.

I prefaced with that backstory to provide a reason why I currently have one halogen, one hid, but... Maybe someone will also be able to give feedback to the situation above.

"I'm thinking whether I should go for diesel or hybrid for my next car. My 2005 Honda Jazz's CVT is starting to slip and I am doing to get a replacement for another second-hand compact car.   


There tends to be a lot of dislike for diesel, mostly about not being able to rev high, longer response time from the engine and heavier engine. However, does it matter for daily drive to work and occasional highway driving?   


In terms of annual fuel costs, it is about the same between hybrid and diesel. Hybrid uses about 50% less fuel for city driving than diesel, but petrol costs about 50% more in New Zealand, so that sort of balances it out.   


With a second-hand hybrid, I have to worry about battery replacement, added complexity, and it is generally more expensive.

"Hey there! I apologize if I'm in the wrong subreddit and hopefully this won't be much of a bother!

So... I'm writing a story and there's this character I have who likes cars and he likes speed, but not in an unhealthy way. Thing is, I'm not sure what type of car he would drive, brand and model-wise.

My story takes place in the early 2000s and he got his car in the 90s. I've kept looking up different types of cars but I'm not sure what fits the ""I like cars and I'll even race sometimes, but I am not a collector or too passionate"". The character is just upper middle class, but he's not the type to drive a very expensive car. He's also really into building and rebuilding and modifying cars or bikes or electronics he puts his hands on. BMW M5 is the only car I've thought of so far, because it goes pretty fast and it could be modified, but I'm not sure and if anything pops in your mind following this description, I'd be thankful.

"I'm kind of a new driver and I'd like to understand this once and for all. Why would going at 150 mph at a highway (just an example) consume less fuel compared to driving on a very busy road with lots of stops and signals. I've always assumed like since you are going faster, the faster you'll run out of gas, as well. I do understand why having to stop too many times may consume A TON of gas but I can't get why does it consume MORE compared to highways when you are accelerating and going at high velocities. For example, the faster you run, the faster you'll run out of stamina/breathe. Of course, I'm not saying these both are the same cases but that has always been my process of thought here. I always assumed the slower you're going, the less gas you'll consume since you are not pushing your engine to its limits. That's how I always thought. I probably sound too dumb asking this but I'm up to learn new things! What is the science behind it?

So, if you’re driving and one side of the lane is clear of snow and ice (salted, melted, and dry) while the other side of the lane isn’t clear (ice or small accumulation of snow - so not more than 2”), what is the technical explanation of the process that happens? Does the ‘ice’ side lose traction and overwhelm ‘dry’ side because it can’t compensate? Does the ‘dry’ side get ahead of the ‘ice’ side and because it has less traction it slips?

"I’m typing this for 2 reasons:
1. I just want people to know.
2. I want a second opinion.

I absolutely love gas cars. I love the noise, I love the mechanics, I love the vast amount of different things I can do to make it better or worse. I would say that over 90% of my interests is taken up by cars(the other 10% is hanging out with people).

I am in high school and I feel like by the time I can do stuff with my car, I won’t be able to. I’m afraid because gas prices are going up, electric cars are being made, and parts for older cars like mine are being discontinued.

I feel like the majority of people would like the automatic transmission, cruse control, and a quiet electric engine. But I would sacrifice all comfort and convenience for performance. My perfect car would probably be a small JDM car with a nice high performance I4 or V6, it would be a manual, and it would probably be rwd, I am absolutely sure that the car will be from 1990-2005.

Now back to the topic

I am, as the title says, afraid of the future of cars. 

If I am forced to give up IC engines for electric engines, I will no longer have an interest in cars. I won’t get to hear the satisfying roar of the engine, and I won’t get to have much fun with the car as it will have an automatic transmission and a lot more electronics.

The main thing is I want to be in control of my car.

" Hi everyone,

I'm running into an issue on my Citroen C4 Picasso:

• 2010

• Automatic transmission

• 1.6HDI 80kW (109hp)

• 160.000 Km (100.000 miles)

Here's the story:

First of all, I really don't drive much as I work from home (20km/12miles per week).

So, a few weeks ago, my car didn't want to start. It was giving sign of a low battery (it was trying to start but couldn't, lights were going on/off). Normal, it's an old battery, it's cold outside and I don't drive much.

My dad came with cables and started my car using his own car. It worked great, I could drive for another 2-3 weeks.

Then, once again, couldn't start. I thought okay, let's change the battery as it's probably really used and I don't drive as much as needed to recharge it. So I don't have to call my dad every 2 weeks.

So, I've bought another battery. We've installed it, the car didn't want to start AT ALL. It wasn't trying to start like it was doing with my old battery (the continuous ""tic tic tic"" that you can hear). No sounds, no start, nothing. I thought the battery I've bought was low, effectively it was at 40%. So I've charged it. It didn't went well and didn't charge, so I guess it must be defectuous.

Well, let's buy another battery at my local car seller. Same, nothing works.

Here are the symptoms:

• Doesn't start at all (doesn't even try to)

• Weird electronics bugs (sometimes lights go on, sometimes not, sometimes it says I've got a lot of alerts e.g. brakes etc, bip bip everywhere, sometimes it doesn't say anything, etc... you get it).

Here's what we've tried:

• All 3 batteries (old one manually charged, ""defectuous?"" one, newest one)

• Placing battery, waiting 5 minutes

• Using the second key to unlock the car

• Waiting 3 minutes when placing the key before trying to start the car

• Connecting the car to another car using cables (car doesn't try to start neither)

• Checking the fuses right next to the battery (they're all good)

• Checking somes fuses here and there (some fuses we can't access though due to the design)

Do you have any idea what could cause this weird issue? Something must have happened when replacing the old battery with a new one so that it doesn't start anymore and electronics seems buggy.

Thank you very much for taking the time to reply.

Kind regards",Citroen C4 Picasso 2010 doesn't start after changing battery,1.0,cars,Jihaysse,True

The story is actually extremely funny. 

  
He walked into a Dealer in Germany, and went looking at 356s, But they were all in bland colors, and sitting beside them was a 300SL in a bright Vibrant Blue. and he looked dead at the Porsche Salesmen. and asked ""can i have one of these, in that color?"" Took him like 4 months of calls between Mercedes, Porsche, and others. But he did get his Mercedes Blue 356 Coupe. 

  
Mercedes was the one against it, as the Blue he was asking for was Exclusive to the 300Sl I believe (don't quote me on this I'm not sure) But he did eventually get it and he drove it out of the Porsche Factory in that bright Shiny Mercedes paint.

"My car is about 10 years old, over 100k miles, 6-speed manual transmission.

Also, I’ve noticed that gently (but also kind of forcibly) smacking the shifter to the left it’ll unstuck it such that I can shift into fifth or sixth gear. 

What is going on and how serious of a problem is it?

FWIW, I had the same make and model car before my current one and a similar thing had happened.

"I drive a run-of-the-mill 3.6L Subaru with a CVT. It's a great little engine all things considered - not the most efficient, not the most modern, but nice and smooth and acceleration never feels overly limiting. 

There is one thing about it that gets me though. The CVT simulates a 5-speed automatic by fake shifting (nothing new there), but the ""first gear"" is so long that it doesn't get to the top of the RPM range until 80km/h. That got me thinking: how much quicker would the car be if they just added two gears under the current ""first gear""? Similarly, if hypothetically, they used a 8-speed DCT, would that bring down the 0-60 time by any meaningful amount? 

If a gearbox change does influence performance, how often is it actually done with project cars?

it was at night the same day, i was walking with my cousin and he told me that ""ADS doesn't let the cars lose traction"" so i told him ""man it's not ADS where are you guys getting that word from???""

he said it's definitely ADS and said ""wanna bet? i'll give you anything if it's TC-whatever that you say"" i said ""sure i'll take your car""

"2014 Holden colorado RG LTZ blowing white smoke

Hello I’m not too car technical but today I was driving my Colorado and I swapped it into 4wd mode and all of a sudden my revs were too high, the diff sounded like it crunched and it was blowing soot everywhere. I swapped it back to 2wd and it went back to normal and was blowing white smoke but cleared off after a few minutes. Now on startup it blows white smoke any ideas

"Thanks in advance for any all responses and advice.

Story as old as time, a little over a month ago my 2012 Kia Optima with 146k miles had its second ever engine failure. Took it to the dealership, managed to enact the lifetime warranty on the engine, as one does, and waited. 

Got a call a week ago that having replaced the engine and finally being able to try to start the car again, they found the issue to be the GDI pump. No longer a covered issue. \~$1100. Hoping against hope that this was the one thing I'd have to pay for to get my car back, I agreed for them to do the job. Alas.

Another few days, and Kia decides they don't want to keep paying Enterprise for my complementary rental, so they switch me over to a loaner. While I'm there, the mechanics are telling me that they still can't quite figure out what's wrong, that they're in active communication with the factory about it, etc.

Got a text today that a faulty grommet was allowing water to enter the ECU and cause damage, necessitating the need for a full ECU replacement. I've been quoted an additional $3159...... 

My question I guess is what would you do? I've been driving this car for over 10 years now, and I'm not in the worst position to start shopping around, but after having done all that work only for it keep costing this much just feels ridiculous. And since it's not even really road safe until the issue is fixed, is my only option to junk a car with a fresh engine I just paid $1100 in parts and labor for?

"ICE is internal combustion engine incase some don’t know 


With most ICE cars being on average ~3000lbs-3500lbs and most EV’s in the ~4500lbs-5500lbs, ICE cars seem to be at a huge disadvantage from weight alone. EVs will always be able to engineer more sturdy safety structures with no engine taking up valuable space. 

EVs are going to get heavier while I’m not sure the same is true for ICE’s. The gap will spread. If most deaths from accidents start to come from those in ICE cars in collisions with EV, that could be the tipping point for EV adoption. Or ICE cars move to mid engine, freeing up space for more safety structures? Not sure.

"Tl;dr, gm financial took over a year to finally be ready to register my truck and I'm wanting to give them a piece of my mind.

I'm not entirely sure where to post this, but I've been trying to get my truck registered for over a year. I've called a few times and was told I would be contacted for a follow up after 24-48 hours only to never hear from them. I've now recently gotten a call from the financier, GM financial, saying I never gave an address for a notary for them to send the title to (their form didn't ask and I wasn't told to supply). 

My problem is that this truck has been a pretty big stressor for me as I drive cross country for work and have moved fairly recently. I've now got close to 30k on it and it's never been registered or inspected! When I asked GM financial what happens when I get pulled over for a tag thats registered, and expired, to my last truck they could only tell me to ""tell them you just moved and your paperwork is on the way"". I personally don't believe that excuse would work at all, especially after being over a year out. Let alone that it left my girlfriend and I stranded on the side of the road for labor day weekend with 852 miles and was given a run around, we barely got a tow truck. Then after it was done being serviced they left trans fluid all over the engine bay and fender. By these powers combined, I'm slightly upset.

Overall I like the truck, but I feel the stress they've put me through is unacceptable. I use this truck for work and keep my tools in it, if I were to get pulled over and the truck towed I'd be out of work entirely and stuck with a huge bill to cover for their lack of effort. If anyone else has ever had any experience like this I would absolutely love to hear from you or any suggestions.

"Hi all,

I have an '09 Honda Odyssey, on which the serpentine belt is worn (and is now squealing). I am certain I had the timing belt replaced probably 30,000 miles or less ago. My neighborhood mechanic claims usually people replace timing belts and serpentine belts at the same time, so if I had the timing belt fixed, it's almost certain the serpentine belt was replaced. This led him to believe there must be an oil leak somewhere causing problems with the serpentine belt. But I'm not clear he ever found one or evidence for one, and we've had communication problems since then.

"Hi all, So I recently had some transmission issues with my 2013 V6 Mustang. I brought it to the shop on January 6th and when I was talking with the guy before I dropped my car off I said ""Do you have time to look at it today"" and he said ""Sure, it'll be a few hours but I can look at it"" and I said ""not a problem I will drop it off take your time"" . I ended up taking the day off from work thinking it was just a sensor issue (that's what the code was throwing) that could be replaced quickly.  He didn't get back to me until the end of the day where I actually had to call them for an update , and the receptionist responded ""He said he would have to take a look at it tomorrow, there was no time today"". So, I'm like, alright, slightly pissed off about the communication issue but whatever.  My car is literally broken, I will leave it in this guys hands to take care of. I trust him. 

As the week goes on, he tells me about still waiting on a part for the transmnission and how my gasket around the differential looks like it could be replaced. It was leaking (I've never seen any leaks on the ground where I park, but he assured me there was a leak) I told him to go ahead and fix whatever needed to be fixed then and  to proceed. 

I called them Friday the 14th, to which he told me ""It will be ready by Monday night"" I figured , that's great I was off on Monday so that would be fine. Monday comes and goes and I don't get a call until the end of the day that my car will be ready on Tuesday by the afternoon. I said no problem I'll get it then. 

Tuesday I ended up taking off from work in anticipation of having to get my car. I get no call from anyone all day. I ended up calling at around 3:00 because I know they sometimes leave the shop early around 4. I call and call and no one picks up. I wait 20-30 minutes and call again. I must have called 6 times and no one picked up at all. 

I need my car back in order to get to work. I have been calling them all morning and left a voicemail.

To me it makes more sense to get something ""classic"", or at least a bit older, especially if you have to finance. These cars might actually appreciate, or at least be stable in value. 

Older cars usually offer a more analogue and visceral driving experience, and are often more solidly built than new models.

And even if they need repairs, the increased cost of maintenance is still usually less than the cost of a new vehicle.

Im now worried that I: 

1. I put too much money down. 
2. Purchase price too high, there are other (new) cars, I could probably squeeze into. 
3. The car will depreciate heavily from here.   

For example, how much money would I lose if I sell it back to Carvana now? 
How much money will I lose in depreciation in 3 years if I sell it then?  
Maintenance costs from 60-90k? will be costly, would it make sense going with a higher fixed payment in a newer car?

Purchase price: 36,590
Sales Tax: 2,424
Down Payment: 20,000
Loan amount: $18,914
Drive: 10k Yr. 
Payment: $300/mo. 

Carvana offers me $32,9k. to take it back.

Now, this noise would stop after 5 seconds and wouldn't happen every time I start the car, maybe a few times a week. When I was driving to my workplace a half-hour away, it did it 3 separate times. I've been scouring the internet for any noise similar to it but haven't found anything. Anyone have any ideas? I also managed to take a video of it happening while I was in park. TIA

"I am so confused as to what to get! I consider myself a car nut; so these two are different but looking for the better overall vehicle.

My choices are the 2022 BMW X6M Competition and the 2022 Macan GTS …

I have allocation(s) for both to build them however I want.

I want a daily driver, that I can just fit in my bike into and my German shepherd (on long road trips, as I have a beater for that). 

I value these and they’re all important to me…
- Performance
- Comfort
- Stereo system (I can build bother Burmester / Bowers &amp; Wilkins) 
- Reliability (as I will be buying the car)
- And overall, the better vehicle

I enjoy driving my cars sporty, but also being able to put my endurance bike in there.

I know the difference is 617 HP Comp vs 434 Macan GTS… I hear the Macan GTS just handles superbly and is also reliable as hell. I heard the BMW X6M is just a beast (I haven’t driven the 2020+ yet, but the older one was insane).

"Is it a myth that they do?  Any evidence?  I'm just really skeptical. 

People like to give three reasons (among others) why short rams hurt low end torque. 

1. It hurts low end volumetric efficiency. 

2.  The air is more turbulent coming in without a tube and so leads to inconsistent AFR. 

3. The resonances are lower with a peak in the low end. 

But I just am skeptical of all three. Here's why. 

1. Just seems bizarre. I see absolutely no reason why this would be true and most ECUs do things to maintain a nice VE map anyway.  I've seen Bernoullis principle cited in support and I just do not see how this would work.  For one, it just isn't true that longer tubes a priori sustain a lower air pressure. There are more harmonics with a longer tube as well as pressure from the walls. You can get a nice pressure gradient from just little geometric nudges that engine makers are already familiar with. 

2.  For the same reasons as 1 I'm skeptical.  There should be less pressure variations in a shorter tube because of that.

3.  I just do not see how this helps anything.  Resonances do not create significant air flow or a large pressure drop across the entire length of the tube, which is what would be needed.  For a normal tube the fundamental would be ~100hz anyway so its up to peak amplitude harmonics being in the 1500-3000 rev range anyway which seems unlikely and can be done easier with a shorter tube with a fundamental in that range not a longer one. 

There are other explanations but they seem weirder. I just want to know if there's any evidence to back up these claims. To me, as a person with a ""hot air"" intake with a long crossover tube, a short ram just seems objectively better.

"Started our 2019 Honda Passport today with about a half inch of iced-over snow on the windshield. Turned on the defroster (front and rear) and waited to see how long it would take for the ice to melt.

About 20 minutes into this process, the wipers suddenly activated and skipped across the ice on the windshield. Immediately I realized they were on the ""auto"" rain sensing setting, which is why they activated, and so I shut them off when they got back to their starting position after that one swipe across the windshield.

My concern is whether they were attempting to activate that entire time, over and over again, for the entire 20 minutes leading up to when I visibly saw them move across the windshield. And in turn, whether that may have caused damage to the wiper motors and/or transmission unit.

In case it's helpful to know, when the wipers activated, the defroster had just finally melted the first few inches of ice from the bottom up. Leading me to think maybe the motor was trying to activate the whole time, but couldn't move the wipers due to them being frozen in place.

I have seen conflicting information about this online, and frankly it's been hard to find anything concrete after more than an hour of googling.

My wife ""has to believe"" that Honda built in some kind of fail safe to guard against this, seeing as how common it must be for people to leave their wipers permanently set to auto. And her father, who knows his way around cars, seems to think all modern wiper motors are brushless and thus they wouldn't be damaged by this type of scenario.

I would like to believe them, but I've seen enough people taking about burned out wiper motors on various forums online, that I'm trying to get more opinions on the matter, in order to ultimately decide whether it's worth replacing the entire assembly as a precaution. This is a family vehicle and the last thing I would want is my wife driving down the freeway in a storm and suddenly the wipers don't work leading to an accident.

"The WRX was redesigned for the 2022 year. According to posts and a video debuted by Subaru, it got a lot of pushback for numerous reasons. IIRC, some of the reasons would have to do with styling and the other would have to do with the numbers (specifically with the 0-60 times and driving factors). I don’t know what enthusiasts opinions are now, since car reviewers are already doing YouTube videos about it, explaining it in detail. (Correct me if I am wrong about this)

The 9th Generation Civic (which was redesigned in 2012), also got numerous pushbacks mainly due to build quality. This led Honda to do an emergency refresh in 2013. They even apologized to everyone saying they would do better.

Here are some questions that add on to this:

1. What are your opinions on the styling of the 2022 WRX now that you saw it in YouTube videos and saw reviewers explaining the car in detail?

Fast forward - just today here at Dallas, I needed to make a lane change to the right in an unknown neighbourhood, but I didn’t realize I was still on the outer side of the two left-turn only lanes.

Premium gas at the time was $4+ per gallon and I was making $15 and hour, then driving 150+ miles a day going to and from work as well as going to school.   


I have been looking around at STI's again but people are wanting 25K for their 06 that's been heavily fucked with and in most cases blown, swapped and put back on the market with ""5000 miles on build..."" Seems I have missed something in the past 10 years because I was under the impression that MOST parts and labor don't up the cost of your car all that much.. I'll be damned if these dudes aren't listing brake pads and fluid's and wanting reimbursed like they did something to it. So Subaru's are pretty much out of the question.   


\-I would like to get something within the next 6 months to a year that's mostly stock (if not all stock) and has potential for growth.  


\- Preferably it would have around 300hp or more and not front wheel drive.   


\-I like all wheel drive but I am open to rear wheel as well.   


\- No more than 10 years old and lower mileage   


I have looked at some Mustangs and I don't mind them. I dont think I could pull the trigger and feel like I have something cool when there are so many on the road though. Any sort of direction is appreciated.

With the transition to electric it seems much easier for car companies to build a capable all wheel drive system by sticking multiple electric motors.

I try to leave my car running for a bit after the three-minute drive home (long enough to remove the moisture), but when I look out the window a few hours later, it's often iced up. Even when I get in my car to *go* to the gym (before I get hot and sweaty), I sometimes run into this.  


I have no leaks, I have two big socks filled with cat litter in my door pockets, I've used Rainx fog treatment, I remove as much snow from my shoes as possible, I crack windows when they're not frozen shut, I crank the defrosters and make sure the AC is on, etc. -- I'm basically doing everything you're told to do when you Google this sort of thing.

However, with winters constantly below freezing, the battery can be an issue. Instead of replacing it often, I was looking into a potential drip-charge device.

Something to keep it stable or slowly charge it over the days.

I'm not sure what device to get, or if I should even get one.

The battery was replaced by AAA four years ago. It still works fine, but I want to be prepared.

Any advice or insights are welcome! Thanks!",Battery Maintenance on a 2007 Nissan Versa,1.0,cars,Caiden_The_Stoic,True

"There was a thread the other day linking to a July 1992 review of a bunch of sub-$10k compacts. 

One of those compacts, the [Plymouth Sundance America](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/s1e9c4/ford_escort_vs_nissan_sentra_saturn_sl_and_nine/hs7omrk/?context=3), caught my attention because of that name. 

After looking it up, I discovered that the three trims that the Plymouth Sundance came in were: America, Highline, and Duster. 

Those three trims have been stuck in my head for days now. I am in awe of their lack of intuitiveness in terms of either sequence or expectation. Looking at it, it's really hard to know which of those are meant to be the base, and if others are better trims, in what way. I found the answer [eventually](https://www.cars.com/research/plymouth-sundance-1992/trims/), that America was the base trim, Highline was the mid-level, and Duster was the top trim. I know Plymouth sold a car in the 70s called the Duster, so that conjures up notions of 70s muscle cars, but what that means in relation to a 90s compact, and especially what it means in relation to American or Highline, who knows? 

It feels like, in order to be intuitive, trim levels either need to be sequential or be words that carry with them further semiotic meaning. For example, my Encore came in Essence, Preferred, or Sport Touring trims. While they're not inherently sequential, the words themselves clue you into their intended decoded meaning: Essence means the basic nature of something. There's your base trim. Preferred means ""the one you actually want,"" there's your mid-trim, and Spot Touring is literal (for however silly the notion of a ""sport touring"" Buick Encore is). Or the Ford Maverick that I'm really interested in, it comes in XL, XLT, and Lariat. Sure, if you're not familiar with Ford, ""Lariat"" might not mean much to you, but when you consider that XL and XLT are sequential, then you can pretty easily deduce that Lariat is the top trim. 

So all that to ask this: What's some other unintuitive sets of trim levels? Trims where either the names themselves or the order they're in don't do a lot to let you know what you're actually getting?",What are the least intuitive sets of trim level?,1.0,cars,RhinestoneTaco,True

"I really need advice with my situation. 

Back in May of 2021, I got a 2017 Kia Forte from a local dealerahip and I'm getting it financed. This is my first car. It only had one owner before me, and I started it with 29k miles. I am now at 41k miles (I've been on a few long distance road trips). I have taken my car in for scheduled maintenance servicing and properly takin care of it.

After a few months of having the car, I noticed that my engine would rarely shake when I'm idle. I called the dealership repair center to inform them and get it looked at because I was very worried. When I brought it in, they looked at it and just shrugged it off that my car is ""overloaded"" because I'm running the A/C and using other things like the radio (I now understand that what they told me is absurd). I didn't know better as a new driver, but it didn't sound right to me.

Now, my car is shaking every time I drive, a few minutes after starting it. It gets worse when I'm idle, but continues to shake when I drive. If I turn the car off and back on, it picks back up after a minute. Also, my car's Malfunction Indicator Lamp lights up for my emission control system now when it never did before. 

A family member who is a mechanic took a look at my car earlier today. He used a reader and said that cylinder 4 is misfiring. That means that spark plugs and coils will need to be replaced, along with anything else related that also has issues. 

I have had problems with this dealership before, and honestly they're getting on my nerves. I haven't even had this car for a year, and stuff like this is breaking down with less than 60k miles? I know that the factory warranty will cover something like this, but for the mechanic to just push me aside like I don't know anything?? Its just overload, lol, okay sure. I know what a car sounds like when you have the A/C or heat on full blast - it doesn't do this. The radio and headlights have nothing to do with the engine! Did they think I'm just that dumb, or are they just that ignorant?

Either way, I really hate my dealership and want nothing to do with them after this, not to mention what has happened before between us. I really don't want to keep this car anymore in case there are any other underlying problems just waiting to happen, or for them to shrug me off again. I'm calling the dealership tomorrow to let them know about the troubles I've had with their mechanic. I would like to know if I could even do anything in regards to getting a different car from a different dealership, or if anyone recommends to go to a different mechanic and see if anything else is wrong. I just don't want people to take advantage of me and charge me up the wazoo for anything they can get because I'm inexperienced. I will take any and all advice into consideration and will discuss more with anyone in the comments.

"I recently learned about the upcoming Hyundai Ioniq 5 electric SUV (apparently it's in Spiderman but I didn't watch it). Personally, I think the [exterior styling](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2022-hyundai-ioniq-5-01-1639159114.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&amp;resize=980:*) is [stunning](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2022-hyundai-ioniq-5-06-1639159092.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&amp;resize=980:*), especially in this era of awful massive front-ends/grilles and past styling powerhouses hiring designers who apparently go to work while having the [worst shroom trip imaginable](https://www.bmwusa.com/content/dam/bmwusa/Concept-Vehicles/xm/overview/desktop/BMW-SOC-XM-LandingPage-Intro-Desktop.jpg) (cough BMW cough cough), especially with all the new EV designs coming out. On a tangent, it seems that the next era of exterior styling and design language is currently being fought out and I think stuff like the Hyundai is going to age a lot better than stuff like the XM

However, when I was looking at the photos of the Ioniq 5, it felt like I was slapped in the face when I got to [the interior](https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/hyundai/2022-ioniq-5-ne-0015:16-9?wid=1920&amp;hei=1080&amp;qlt=85,0). The door handles look cheap, I think a flat floor space between the driver and passenger footwells always looks and feels cheap, and besides the touchscreen the interior looks like it could be 15 years old. I can't feel or touch it, but visually it reminds me of the plastic interior of a [2010 Dodge Journey](https://www.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/10/2015/11/2010-dodge-journey-sxt-suv-dashboard.png?fit=around%7C770:481.25). From [outside the driver door looking in](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2022-hyundai-ioniq-5-26-1639159160.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&amp;resize=980:*), it feels like stepping into a [2005 Honda Pilot](https://static.cargurus.com/images/site/2018/02/04/08/28/2005_honda_pilot_lx_awd-pic-6528087475155943548-640x480.jpeg). My mom's new Crosstrek looks and feels far more [comfortable and welcoming](https://secure-akns.subaru.com/content/media/mp_fullscreen_1920/22_CTK_gallery_int_02.jpg).


I admit this is probably hyperbole and a lot of people out there probably like the simplicity of the interior, but to me it looks cheap and tacky and gives me the exact opposite impression the exterior styling does, and I think I would hate to sit inside it. 

This made me think, what other cars in production right now, or very recently, have the best exterior styling with the worst interior? I think it would be too easy to answer this with stuff from the 80s and 90s, so I am focusing on modern stuff from right now or the past decade, but definitely add your best pick of older cars for bonus points. Besides the Ioniq 5, I also nominate the most [basic trim Mustang](https://build.ford.com/dig/Ford/Mustang/2021/HD-FULL/Image%5B%7CFord%7CMustang%7C2021%7C1%7C1.%7C100A.P8T..PG1..882.891.~2WW00_BCMAB.13D.COU.59C.LRS.LTS.64A.TDP.RWD.453.99H.50B.58A.SYN.44X.EBST.LESS.CLO.MST.%5D/INT/2/vehicle.png); it's not even close to as bad as the Ioniq 5, but for such a cool exterior, the interior suffers at that price point",Which cars have the highest contrast between best exterior styling and worst interior?,1.0,cars,SF-cycling-account,True

"The obvious answer is so people can have more space inside. 

However, if you want more space, wouldn't it make more sense to buy the larger model? Look at how large a current 2022 Toyota Corolla is compared to a Corolla from 2003. The 2022 model is nearly as large as a Toyota Camry from 2003. If the people who were buying a Toyota Corolla wanted a Corolla with more space, wouldn't it make more sense to buy the Toyota Camry? 

The 2022 Hyundai Tucson is now larger than a first generation 2005 Hyundai Santa Fe because people wanted the interior space of a larger SUV instead of actually just buying the larger SUV. 

Because of this constantly growing trend, today's cars are gargantuan compared to previous generations. I don't even know how someone is able to successfully drive the new Cadillac Escalade down a narrow street.

"I got a 2017 F250 that’s worth more than I bought it for a few years ago. I know this but everytime I think to list it there’s this mental block in my head that prevents me from listing it.

I’ll be honest, I don’t use the truck for shit other than driving around with my girlfriend and sometimes taking it into fields and sleeping in a tent in the bed. I don’t have obnoxiously big deep dish wheels or even a lift on the truck, so it’s not like I’m super invested in it other than the payments I’ve made so far.

This truck isn’t even the first car I’ve owned, I also have a Scion tC that I still drive and that’s the first car I ever bought. But I think since the truck is newer it feels like my first new car. 

I’ve put 6k miles on it since I got it in June 2019. Basically what I’m trying to say is I don’t need it, but what is stopping me from getting rid of it? I think I could get close to $40k if I bring it to a local Ford dealer and that would leave me with a little over $20k after paying it off. I’d use that for an investment property. 

I usually use logic to make my decisions but I keep thinking about how happy I was when I got that truck and it’s so hard for me to give it up.

"I don’t know a lot about cars so I’m sorry in advance lol 

I bought a 2002 Toyota Camry LE 2.4L a few months ago for $1350, which is currently at 175,000 miles. It was my first large purchase and I was really in need of a car. 

The car was already loud but yesterday it started making a new noise while my boyfriend was driving and it was because the car had been running with little to no oil often. I knew there was an oil leak and was told by auto zone that I could fix some gasket in the engine, which I had my boyfriend do and I guess it didn’t fix the oil leak because I still put oil in the car all the time just for it to never have oil when checked and I always get oil changes every 3,000 miles. 

I was told that the engine locked because of the lack of oil and I wasn’t even able to make it home before the car stopped and I had to get it towed home. 

I am currently looking into 2 options: 

1. Replace the engine 
2. Sell the car 

Selling the car would be difficult because the title isn’t in my name yet, so I still need to spend $300 to $400 at minimum getting the title transferred (because it will be a different state and to cover the taxes) and more money for the state inspection I will need to transfer the title 

In my (uneducated) opinion, I really want to just get a used engine put in it because I believe it will fix the other main issues that I already knew about: 2 cylinder misfires and the leaky oil problem 

Some other things wrong with the car that I know about are that I need a new EVAP solenoid vacuum hose and new rear brake pads and rotors 

I am reluctant to buy a new car because of how long and stressful the process is and because it will have to be an old, under $2000 car with a whole new set of issues that will take me a few months to figure out and even longer to be able to afford to fix them 

I need a vehicle soon because I do deliveries as my main source of income and need to be working but I cannot right now with no car. I also have ADHD and getting an hourly job isn't an option for the sake of my mental health and bank account. 

What do I do? 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: 

2002 Toyota Camry bought for $1350 (currently at 175,000 miles) 

My engine is locked and I want to get a new engine but don’t know if I should just sell the car 

If I get a new engine, I will have a vehicle much sooner and it will fix lots of other issues that I already needed to fix 

If I sell, I have to pay to transfer the title to a new state AND deal with another cheap (under $2000) car with a whole new set of potential issues

"Here's a question I have not found a definitive answer to, hoping there is an expert lurking here that can answer it.

I own a Mazda CX-9 with the 2.5T engine. It's flexible on fuel, 87 will yield 227hp and 93 will yield 250hp.

Here's the question: I live in Denver. How does altitude effect this?  


Here in Denver 93 octane basically does not exist. Because of the decreased atmospheric pressure lessening the chance of knock, we get most commonly 85, 87, and 91 at the pump. So, what happens if I run 85, or 91 in it?  


Let's say at sea level the ambient pressure is 15psi (I know, but round numbers for ease). Let's also say for ease the Turbo is set to 1bar. So, cylinder pressure when the intake valve closes is 30(ish) psi as sea level. Denver is right about 12psi atmospheric pressure. The Turbo is still set to 1 bar. How much pressure is in the cylinder now? 24 (12+12)? 27 (12+15)? 30 (12+18)? Is the turbo pressure measured against absolute pressure, relative pressure, or something else?   


In the end, lacking a definitive answer, I've just been running 87 in it to be on the safe side. However, could I actually run 85 here? Would 91 allow the tune to go up to full power?

"Hey guys. I'm near Toronto, Canada. I'll soon be in a position to potentially get a 2nd car and I want it to be a V8.

The short list is: 

A B8 RS5. However, they are at the very top of my budget. Nearly $50K. And there aren't that many around with decent kms. Most are at or around 100,000 kms. And I don't want a drop top. This is one of my dream cars. But I'm worried about how expensive it might be for maintenance. 

2nd option is a 2015 to 2017 S550 Mustang GT. I known I have to update the shifter cause the MT82 is not reliable. But there is a lot of aftermarket support for this car. And it's 'domestic', parts will be slightly cheaper and more mechanics can repair things. I plan on adding more power to it at some point. 

But I keep reading about horrific traction control failure while people are cornering. And that's spooky. This will be my first manual transmission car. I took a few lessons in how to operate manual cars. But I know I need practice. So definitely not adding power for a while.

I thought about V8 Jags for a while, but figured maintenance would ruin me.

2. Great cornering ability, so really 4x4, ideally with option for RWD
3. Needs 4 seats/doors for family reasons (short school runs only)
4. Cool engine - V8 would be ideal, but out of my budget, R5 is also intersting, with inline-4 being the least preferential (boring) but not a dealbreaker.
5. Ability to fit a bicycle with the wheel removed and back seats folded is also a consideration.

Maybe it is because they are trying to adapt what they presently have and the designs for electric cars will get better.

They do such high quality work and it just makes me wonder what one of their full builds costs given the man hours, attention to detail and highly skilled labour.

As a guide, they have recently collaboated with Redux to produce a restomod E30 M3 that costs £330,000 plus the cost of an E30 M3 which would be £50,000 plus for a nice one. Details of the E30 can be found here, it's a thing of beauty:

https://uk.motor1.com/news/313610/bmw-e30-m3-restomod-redux/

Even given the pricetag of the Redux M3, some of their builds are even more involved,  with extensive metalwork remodeling and even a Jenson CV8 that they are fully rebodying in carbon fibre with a glass roof. One of their builds would be my ultimate money no object pipe dreams, but given that they can count Gordon Murray among their clientele,  I wouldn't be surprised if you could easily spend £500k plus.

"Hi r/cars

I recently upgraded from my stock 2015 Toyota Hilux stereo to a new Sony XAV-AX1000 for the sole purpose of getting Apple CarPlay in my car. 

I have a couple of questions and worries about the new stereo:

1. When ever i turn the ignition on, the car speakers make a ‘pop’ noice which is fairly loud. 

Is this cause for concern, will this blow my speakers if it continues?

2. Sometimes when using Waze + Apple Music, Waze will make an alert (speed limit, traffic ect) and when the voice over finishes, the Musics audio becomes very loud and requires the volume to be readjusted slightly (down 1 bar) and it returns to normal. 

I assume that the 2nd question is just a IOS software bug and nothing to worry about as it will be fixed in a later version, my worries resign more about the first question.

"Before the STI used to have decent power, handling and was generally well respect among it's competition. However nowadays I can't see why someone would purchase one.

 AWD would be the usual answer but you can just get a WRX for a lot cheaper if you need an AWD daily and in the STI territory there's the golf R and you can stretch purchase an Audi which respond much better to mods and I'd wager handle much better.

 If AWD isn't required (realistically for most people it's not) almost every car in the surrounding segment does what the STI does but better, they all can be easily be modded for high HP with more reliability compared to the Subaru which doesn't respond great to mods.

Another question. Why can I put the car into reverse while going forward? Is it because the reverse gear in my car has synchro rings? The first gear in my car has been fucked since I bought it.

Well fast forward a month, the car is no longer charging. We take it to the dealership they tell us it will be at least three days before they can get confirmation that they can do warranty work from Kia, and then it can be up to a month before the repairs happen.

Wait what? Okay well give us a loaner. Dealership tells us there's a wait list for loaners and there's nothing they can do for us. They basically tell us to figure it out 

I decided to call corporate and corporatea response is that we can get up to $25 in rental reimbursement per day, but that there's not really a guarantee that they will actually reimburse us.

"Hi!

I'm posting this here, I'm unsure if it's the right place, please do tell me if I do anything wrong, so I'll correct myself.

Here's the thing. I have a friend who has trouble since some months, with the car battery going empty. He's struggling with money, so he couldn't buy a new battery.

He informed me today that his car got stuck. It's stuck in a field, so it's not mud or snow (that at least something).

He tried to get it out, but didn't succeed and now the car won't start.

I'm going there tomorrow, and I'm trying to figure out a way to get his car on the road, then recharge the battery using my own car.

Logically, there will be just me and him, so just pushing it out don't seem like a viable option.

I'm wondering if attaching a rope solid enough would do it. I'll try it anyway.

So this is why I made this post. In case it doesn't work, are there any other options ? Any idea would be awesome.

Thanks to everyone for any reply.

He turned up with 4 friends and as soon as they got there they were all over the car looking at it, under the hood in the boot, everywhere, and I couldn't keep track of all of them. Anyway we go out for a test drive and the guy was absolutely ragging it, and I said to him what the fuck are you doing it take my car home.

As we get back to mine he launches it again up my road and as he does white smoke starts bellowing out of the exhaust and the check engine light comes on.

Anyway I told them to get off my property and that the car is not for sale, but after this I have been doing some research that there are scammers who put a small amount of coolant in the oil of the car to cause the white smoke and check engine light, I think they may have done this as they were straight in the engine bay as soon as I got there and I couldn't see what was happening.

When it spun the bearing at 3k RPM on the highway it made an awful knock like a jackhammer, sent smoke out the exhaust and I could literally hear chunks of metal falling into the oil pan and going out the exhaust. It died and coasted to a stop. (I would later find [chunks of metal over an inch in diameter in the oil pan after pulling the motor](https://imgur.com/a/Uk6oPrno)). in that moment I knew for certain it was dead. On a whim I tried cranking it over. The fucking thing started right up and *idled* literally with chunks of rod and piston missing. Just out of spite it was like no, fuck you, I'm not ready to die yet. I proceeded to drive it to its final resting place, and then drive it up the ramps where I pulled the engine.

I have a build planned, and am thinking about live streaming the entire build start to finish. I would have to buy additional gear to be able to do this, and that is the main reason for this post. If there is enough interest in something like this, I will go for it. 

I would make it as much if a “community” build as possible, with viewers taking polls on which parts to buy, what color to powder coat components, how much boost to run, etc.. 

At the end of the build, I plan to give away the original engine and transmission from the car. I am local to Holley Performance Products and plan to reach out and see if they would like to help in any way.

I know it will fit my specific car make and model as I entered the info in best buy and they say it will fit. But my concern is whether it will be a good match or not.

"I'm running into some issues diagnosing a starting problem. My friend claims that the car worked fine, then one morning, while turning the key she heard a 'thud' while cranking, after which several warning lights turned on on the dash, and the car would crank only very slowly. She tried it again later, but more and more electrical components started switching off/ not working. She said she tried running jumper cables from another car, but only the headlights turned on and nothing else happened.

&amp;#x200B;

What I've tried: 

\-tested battery: 2.5V; 

\-tested most fuses, all good; 

\-ran jumper cables from another car directly to the car's leads, having disconnected de dead battery, car seemed fine, but it was cranking over very slowly, and the dash was flickering and had missing pixels while cranking.

&amp;#x200B;

Could a loose ground on the starter motor cause the battery to go that flat and drain the battery that much? The car did have an aftermarket audio system added at one point, the amp was still connected to the battery, so that might have been an additional permanent drain.

"Hi all,
I'm looking to change my OEM radio/nav unit (Opel/GM '06 CD70) for a new aftermarket one.

I'd like to change it for a 2-din one with Nav or Phone mirroring options since my old unit is too old and has no updates since 2014.

Within my budget I've found 2 options:
- Pioneer AVH-A240DAB
- Kenwood DMX120BT

They both can display my (android) phone for Nav and have bt streaming.

But, I'm really hesitant to order one of those. The apps you have to install on your android phone, to mirror the screen, are getting so much bad reviews that I don't know what to do.

The Pioneer unit uses something called WebLink , Wich has very bad reviews in play store, is not compatible with every app and is even already discontinued according to some sources.

The Kenwood unit uses its own app for screen mirroring but gets a lot of bad reviews as well. People saying that it just won't work (especially under yt video's of Kenwood themselves)

In the past, I've used cheap Ali/eBay Android and WinCE units, and I seriously won't go that road again.

Can anyone give me some advice on what to do? Do you guys have any experience with the screen mirroring functions on Pioneers and Kenwood's?

I would start this post as, Gas Station Manager. AMA. This really pertains to the USA, and yes this post is about gas, and the raise in prices, but not what you think. Please keep politics out of it, it runs much more closely than you think. 


So, what causes the prices to be what they are? It really comes down to competition, alot of data, AI, and good ol dolla dolla.


It is my job to try to sell the most amount of gas in value alongside our minimart products such as fountain soda, slushies, and cigarettes w/ OTP which have the most amount of markup and margin. You can hate me all you want, but eventually you'll find a shmuck that will do it anyways. My bonuses are set to that of what my sales are according to my DM's total market sales. Keep in mind that I also have to pay the prices I set, so it's kinda personal. This not a relatively small station. Just checked my books, and we just did 16,000$ worth just yesterday. At ~3.73 a gallon as of this post. That's a lot of gallons. Especially in the summer and ""playtime"" months and days with various toys, it could easily be double that. We don't personally serve diesel, but I have been to places that have. That's where the big money comes in from huge tanks. A general rule of thumb in my area is that diesel is price equivalent to premium / plus fuel.


Down to the actual breakdown. We have this neat software called Kalibrate. The big scary numbers on the screen. Essentially, Kalibrate behind the scenes will calculate gas prices based on trends and what people are willing to pay specific to each area and to each brand and site. If you go to the Kalibrate site themselves, you can see the range of services they offer.


 https://i.imgur.com/C2P9SOR.jpg - This is my end of the system. I can see the prices of everybody in my area including those who aren't of my same fuel. How do they get that data? Reconissance. Yes seriously. If you've ever worked as a cashier at a gas station, and someone calls to check on prices, it is against most company policies to say the actual price. Now I personally don't do it myself, I can, which is fun. But someone does and feeds it into the system. Which is why the dates are sometimes staggered. On the other tab, it will push suggested prices, or force prices that corporate descends upon us.


Anyhow, that goes up into the cloud where Kalibrate will attempt to see what people are willing to pay for, at what price. If it can raise the price, while keeping an equal amount of individual sales, unfortunately, it will. 


Let's say you want a manual override. Mom and pop station. You can set gas to be super cheap, at let's say a dollar and will sell alot, but you will struggle to break even on your raw gas deliveries alongside mandated taxes as you just use up so much fuel. Reduce the amount of gallons you use while still making money, less taxes, less deliveries, simple. Some devious parts of you hearing this may then say, set the price to 10 bucks because people NEEED gas, but then you genuinely lose sales, and will quickly become an outlier because of everybody's established prices around you. You will make your area's QOL of go down. It's a fine balance, and more of a negotiation bouncing off of people's data and wallets. 


Yes, there is a form of just hard prices created by geo and political conundrums, but it's only a part of the equation that boils down to local economies.

“Ok I'm going to teach you about selling enthusiast cars.

This car is an entry level sports car. Entry level. Meaning the price point and power are both usually in the lower bracket.

The 2022 Subaru BRZ are not getting any mark ups at all, and they have generally the same supply as Toyota at the moment. People, enthusiasts specifically, are walking out of Toyota dealerships and dodging this weird markup model you guys have been running. It doesn't work. 

A mid level sports car with over 350 horse power starts at 42k, so what makes your dealership think that a car that Toyota had made with cheap components, low horse power, and aftermarket assets is worth being the 10k over msrp you guys slapped on it?

That car is going to sit there, and sit there, until you guys come to your senses stop trying to mark up a car thats specially for enthusiast. It's not a Supra, and It's definitely not a Porsche Cayman. It's an 86. These insane prices is why nobody buys these cars from dealerships. We'd rather sell to eachother and let you guys sell your little carollas and Tacoma's to regular people that have no knowledge in buying cars that are easy to abuse financially. That's on them. But when you horde these sports cars and do weird mark ups like that you're wasting your time and losing business to Subaru. 

There's web pages online full of enthusiasts that are laughing at Toyotas price gouges on a car that has zero civilian use. No regular driver will buy it knowing that they can get something waaay more powerful quicker and faster minus the markup. That'll hold value in the coming years. You can buy a 2012 wide body corvette c5 for 4K less than this inflated price anywhere else, and it talking about fully kitted and everything. Stop this madness and sell the car to someone that actually wants it at msrp.

Also, that's pretty bad salesmanship that you didn't even know the car was manual.  Even after I adamantly told you I saw it on the paper you tried so hard to get me in you either blatantly lied OR didn't care enough to look. Either way it's really bad that the manager of the entire Toyota dealership didn't know that the car he's marking up 4K (for no reason) didn't even know what was rolling inside onto his showcase floor. Horrible. I'm thinking of writing a review and posting the pictures of the nonsensical mark up along with the lies/ignorance you kept up with afterwards. The regular car buyers market would love to see it.

"Who here, as times goes on, will actually keep an older car in the fleet? A car with way less tech or GPS tracking/nannies etc. As tech gets more intrusive and standard requirements get crazier, whether its a second car or a main car, do you plan on keeping an ""off grid"" car for a long time? 

I personally have many pre-OBD1 cars for shows or weekends that I plan to keep long term, but usually my daily driver stays more modern and newer. But as time goes on, and they start implementing, baby sitting tech, I feel I will not enjoy driving that vehicle vs a car I can do whatever I want with. 

I know this might sound like a muscle car guys saying, ""carbs are best, fuel injection sucks"" or some old thinking like that, and ""times change, get with it"". But I think this is different. When they start implementing internal cameras to monitor peoples actions or automatic speed limit control...

"Hey everyone! I'm writing a novel, and I'm trying to achieve realism in it, especially with minor details. I'm an automobile noob, so if my question is stupid, please forgive me. 

In one part of the story, a character hijacks a 2021 model Hyundai Solaris (as far as I know, it's the Russian version of a hyundai accent / Verna) and proceeds to speed off to a location 3,425 km away, reasons for which are within the story itself (sorry, it's a lot to explain and very much irrelevant). Since the car is being hijacked, I shall assume that it has half a tank of fuel left.

My questions are as follows: 

1. Google maps says the location in the story will take 43 hours to reach, which is approx 79-80 kmph average speed. Is this a realistic average speed on Russian roads that are for mostly residential purposes?

2. Does fuel efficiency decrease if there's less fuel in the tank, or can I assume that half a tank of fuel means it'll go exactly half the distance it would on a full tank?

3. Stupid question, but in the story, a man of around 100kgs and an old woman of around 50 kgs are the passengers in this car (total weight is 150 kgs, so 2 average people). According to websites, the ""fuel supply per person"" is 10L per 1 person. What does this mean? Please clarify. Assuming 1 person weighs 75kgs on average, how would this passenger weight affect fuel efficiency?

4. Realistically speaking, on average, how far can the Solaris go when the refuel signal is lit up?

"(I am in no way a professional writer or reviewer. Just a regular car owner, so I apologize for mass grammatical errors.)  

Photos of said car: https://imgur.com/a/DhhYSPP  

Let me preface this by saying that this is the 3rd STI I have owned. I’ve had a 2013, 2016 and a 2019. All 3 were bulletproof as far as reliability went. Only oil changes, new tires, brakes and general fluid changes. I never had any mechanical failure, never needed a tow, drove without issue through 2 feet of fresh snow and all 3 treated me well. I purchased my 2019 STI just shy of 3 years ago. Options included the Option Package #3 (recaro seats and keyless access), short throw shifter, carbon fiber trunk trim and the rear cargo package. MSRP was $41,619. This price sort of places it in a weird segment of its own. A 300+ horsepower manual transmission AWD sports sedan with LSD for 41k. There’s really nothing else on the market with the same features. (For those that don’t know the 2019 got a few upgrades over previous models. Horsepower was bumped from 305 to 310, it received a newer ECU, stronger pistons and a shorter 3rd gear for improved acceleration. BUT, it’s clearly evident that this is an aging platform.)  

First off, it’s an STI- let’s talk performance. The car is downright fun and everything I wanted in a sports sedan. This is not without complaints though. Turbo lag is a real issue with the STI but the engine quickly revs and I got used to the lag (I don’t even notice it anymore). The car begs to be driven aggressively and it rewards you every time with a big smile. Is it the fastest car on the road? No. But it’s the most fun I’ve ever had in a daily driver. Driving on an on-ramp in third gear and speeding to highway speeds never gets old, nor does taking a offramp or driving back roads at high speeds- taking me to the next aspect of performance: the handling. Say what you want about the WRX, the STI is a different beast entirely when it comes to cornering and stability. It’s damn near impossible to break the tires loose. It sticks to the road and goes where you point it without fuss. The downside to this is the car has a jarringly stiff ride. You’ll feel every bump in the road and I do mean every bump in the road. There’s a fine line between a sport suspension and a rough ride. The STI definitely is a rough ride. I’ve taken two road trips in the car and both trips were extremely uncomfortable after a few hours. The seats are stiff, the suspension is stiff and thusly the ride is stiff. It’s a brutal combination for comfort. BUT… it’s a damn fun drive. Lastly the steering is fantastic. Never felt heavy or overly light. Of every car I’ve driven I feel the STI has the best feel when it came to steering. One last night I forgot to add: the shifter (specifically with the STI short shifter) is sublime but third gear for whatever reason can be a bit tricky when rolling through gears quickly.  

The exterior design is take it or leave it. Some people love the design and big wing while others hate it. It’s entirely subjective so I won’t touch on it. The interior I will though. The seats fit you like a glove but as I said previously they are very stiff. The interior layout is spectacular though. Sure, the interior quality may not be the best being it’s a gussied up Impreza but the differences between the STI and Impreza are apparent. The faux leather and red contrast stitching, piano black trim, chrome accents and soft plastics are a nice touch. It isn’t luxury by any means, but it’s nice enough for the price point. All the controls and buttons are easy to reach while driving, the instrument cluster is large and easy to read and the digital speedometer is great (I never even look at the traditional speedometer anymore), even the sound system is decent. Visibility is also excellent. My only real gripe is how loud the interior is. Road noise dominates your drive. Combined with the bangs and booms of bumps in the road and the exhaust it makes for a very loud ride. Being my third I obviously expected a less than comfortable and loud ride, but compared to other sports sedans the STI is by far the most uncomfortable and loud. One other major complaint I have is the fact the arm rest is an option. My car didn’t come with the extended arm rest and while I did eventually get used to it, the fact it’s an option is ridiculous to me. Also, can someone explain to me why the STI doesn’t have auto-locking door locks? Lastly, the infotainment system has a habit of crashing every so often and showing a black screen. This happens maybe every other month and I’ll have to stop the car, shut it off, open/close the door and restart the car to reset the system. It’s annoying but it happens so infrequently that I’ve never been mad about it. It seems to crash exclusively when using the bluetooth phone. I’m not sure why it happens.  

So, all that being said: how is it as a daily driver? My daily commute is roughly 8 miles total to work and back. Over 3 years I’ve clocked 17,5xx miles (covid obviously had a lot to do with the low mileage) of mixed highway but mostly city driving. Gas mileage is atrocious and I do mean atrocious. Combined city and highway I average 17 mpg. Best I ever got on the highway was 24 mpg and in downtown stop and go traffic I’ll get roughly 11 mpg. Spirited driving causes those numbers to plummet. I’m filling up the tank about every 220 miles per 13 gallons and that is 90% standard driving and 10% aggressive driving. When I went on the two road trips I was filling the tank every 4 and a half hours of nonstop highway driving. It’s a thirsty car and if driven aggressively you’ll be at the gas pumps far more frequently. The turning radius is excellent, it’s easy to park and there’s plenty of storage inside the vehicle. Trunk space is more than adequate and the seats fold down to allow extra space. The trunk opening is a tad small though so you won’t be getting large items inside. This is a small side point but the brakes squeal like a school bus but only during light braking. I’ve had that issue with all 3 STI’s and it seems to just be part of the STI experience (verified by most STI owners I’ve met). One other annoying aspect is the stock brake pads produce an excessive brake dust and using the word excessive I feel is downplaying it. You can clean the wheels till you can see your reflection and after a few drives they’ll be back to dull black. The brake dust I’m guessing contributes heavily to the squeal so it’s a nonstop battle. Aftermarket pads did alleviate the issue some, but the squeal persists.  

Conclusions: It’s loud, it’s fun and it leaves you with a smile every time you get out. But it’s loud (both a positive and a negative), it’s stiff, it’s uncompromising, it’s flashy and it’s the thirstiest car I’ve ever owned. Do I have any regrets? Absolutely not. Would I have made the same purchase 3 years ago? Absolutely. So why will my next car not be a 4th STI? In my 20’s daily driving a hard-edged sports sedan was a blast. In my mid 30’s it simply isn’t as much fun anymore. I’d rather sacrifice some of the rougher edged aspects for a slightly slower but significantly more comfortable ride. Riding in my friends Lexus or BMW or practically any other car and then getting in to my STI is like night and day. I keep saying the word ‘fun’ because it’s FUN. But at some point the fun kind of disappears unless you’re really throttling it and you’re left with an extremely uncomfortable and loud ride. At this point in my life I’d rather drive a car that is slightly slower in a 0-60 or has a little body roll in hard corners or isn’t as quick on the highway because comfort is more important to me now than driving a raw sports sedan. With used car prices soaring, and getting an offer to trade in my STI for what I paid for it I simply don’t have an excuse to keep it anymore. Will I miss it? Initially no. But as with everything in life, as time goes on we begin to forget the things we disliked and only remember the positives. In 5 years from now I’ll probably think back on the STI with nothing but positive memories but as soon as I drive one again I’ll tell myself, “this is why I stopped driving these”.",Three year review of my 2019 STI and why I am moving on from the STI,1.0,cars,elloue,True
"TLDR: Electric driving is severely compromised in cold weather and strongly diminishes the 4XE value proposition. 

Longer TLDR: When the temperature is below freezing, the truck will force start the combustion engine even if it has a full battery or is connected to 240V. Short and cold run times on the ICE will cause the car to enter a Fuel and Oil Refresh Mode (FORM). Once in this mode, electric mode is completely unavailable. The process to clear FORM is far from being easy. 

Context: I purchased this car new in April of 2021. I’ve always been wary of first year model production. I was swayed by the fact that the JL platform was 3 years old and the PHEV technology was mostly transposed from the Pacifica Hybrid. On the reliability front, this has borne true for the most part.

This past summer has been an amazing experience with the Jeep. I was coming fresh off a Tesla Model 3 and this SUV was a perfect solution for electric commuting while also allowing me to pursue activities in the wilderness such as fishing and hunting. 

But things have taken a turn for the worse now that the weather is colder. I first noticed that the car would start the internal combustion engine when it was below 0 C (32 F). After reading through the owners manual it described different temperature thresholds for running the ICE. Ok, I can understand the need for additional power to run climate and the drivetrain in cold weather. At first this was not so bad as once the car had sufficiently warmed it would automatically switch to electric mode. 

However, this did not last long as the Jeep soon entered the Fuel and Oil Refresh Mode (FORM). Once in this mode, the car would no longer allow any electric usage. The only way to leave FORM requires driving with the oil temperature above 80 C (176 F) for a long time (almost two hours of highway driving in my experience) or resetting the oil life. 

This cold weather performance is perplexing to say the least. While I certainly don’t think it was malicious, the first deliveries in significant numbers occurred in March-April  and did not allow for a true cold weather experience. Moreover, most reviews for the Jeep came out over the summer season and thus could not capture the shortcomings of the vehicle in colder climates. 

While I am disappointed of the cold weather performance, hopefully software tweaking could alleviate some of these issues. Disregarding aforementioned issues, the Wrangler 4XE has been a great truck and easily ranks as one of my favourite vehicles I’ve owned so far.

"So my compustar system is parasitic draining my battery. I wanted to try a lower power alternative. 

I ordered a BMMPR for Christmas and the customer service has been hell. I should’ve listened to the BBB reviews saying once they buy the device the owner sucks. And they send it back in and don’t get their money back.

First red flag was it said it was shipped and a day away— but they didn’t even ship it out of the warehouse for another week. I called the number and it rang to some guys cell phone. Now if you call it rings once and says “Thank you for calling BMMPR, have a good day.”

So I emailed, a few times. Guy was a dick and said he’s at some CSI convention (like I know what that is?) and he can’t write back lol. No manual, so you don’t know what any of the stats are in the app. 

And the problem itself: I haven’t gotten real time push notification since I bought it. At first I was getting them when I got in the car— like all 15. Not once has it given me an up to date real time notification (it doesn’t come with a manual, and the only advice I could find is redownload the app lol).

Now it only tells me when I start my car, and since I installed it all my dash lights stay on, the emergency lights flash when the cars off. so it 100% fucked with my fuses near my OBD port. If someone has a better recommendation for car cam I’m going to return this one probably.

"In Spain:

• The most popular brand is SEAT, by far. The Seat León and Ibiza are our Honda Civics. There are many SEAT crossovers lately too, the Tarraco, Ateca and Arona from bigger to smaller. The Arona is the best selling car in the country.

• Dacias are very common, especially as Taxis

• Zero Hondas/Acurasand few Toyotas (basically none of them Corollas). All Priuses without exception are Taxis. The Corolla is starting to sell well but it's got a long way to go to become popular. I've never seen a Camry here.

• Zero pickups. I've seen Toyota Hiluxes and maybe Ford Rangers every few months, but I've never seen a Chevy/Ram/F-Series in person.

• Most other European brands are also popular, but not as much as SEAT. Skoda, Ford Europe and especially FCA seem to lag behind.

• No Chevrolets. There used to be Chevy-badged small Daewoos but they are all gone.

• Transit-sized vans are also common here, but the Transit itself lags behind. The Sevel vans and Renault Traffic dominate. Smaller (Kangoo-sized) and Promaster-sized vans are also common, from the same brands 

• Small FCA presence, as I said before. Their only successful car here right now is the Fiat 500. No American FCA cars.

"So, for story, in the UK we recently had a big storm. I was driving home at 3am through this storm, and visibility was sooo bad with trees falling, huge winds and torrential rain.

Long story short, I have a Cold Air Intake and it's stupidly low (I bought it like this with a future plan to figure out better strategies for its placement) and as I drove through a relatively small puddle at low speed my car decided it was thirsty.

Instantly, oil pressure light and loss of power, with a lovely sound of my inline four being turned into a tractor. So obviously big knocks and obviously a misfire. Instantly turned off and only time it's ran since is to drive up the recovery vehicle and to test once and try and diagnose. But it still runs!

So after pulling off the valve cover and having as good of a look as I can before I can get it transported to my garage from my house. I've noticed that piston 1 is not moving at all when cranking and the rest all move quite happily. I have to admit, this took me a while to notice 😅. Again, it was running like this for a short time!

"Hi, so I live in Canada and from what I gather EV’s and cold weather don’t mix. Further, the tier 4 emissions for diesel makes it extremely unlikely for eco diesels to become a thing here. People delete these systems off their trucks all the time. Hybrids are only efficient in 50:50 or more city driving and not cost effective if car is driven mostly highway from my research. Most older cars rev quite high during highway driving. Eg my car revs at 3000rpm at 100-110km/h and would be much more efficient sitting at a lower rpm especially on flat roads. I’ve noticed lots of new model cars recently and seen that the engines are fairly similar to older models (variable valve timing etc) but what’s changing is that manufacturers are putting 8 speeds in them and cvt. Not saying these new 8 speeds/ cvt are reliable but for arguments sake let’s say they are. Curious, what’s to stop someone from taking a 10 year old car, putting an 8 speed in and getting 20% more fuel efficiency over say a 5/6 speed counterpart?

"Per the title, I have a small seeping coolant leak around the 11oclock position of the timing chain cover (which is located between the water pump and the block). I verified this visually with a pressure test.

A few days ago I replaced the water pump, hoping it's gasket was the source of the leak &amp; because it had a 100k miles on it. The same day I replaced the clogged heater core.

I'd like to resolve my leak, and not have to top the coolant every week. The options &amp; pros/cons I believe I have are:

- Pull the part &amp; re-gasket/seal the timing cover. This is clearly the best correct thing to do, but would be EXTREMELY labor intensive.

- Do nothing, and simply maintain the coolant level. This is the simplest, but would irritate the hell out of me.

- Use a stop leak / block seal. I would want to bypass the heater core if I did this. Other than clamping the hoses in/out, is there an established bypass hose kit or something that I could just connect around the thermostat housing &amp; water pump to totally bypass the whole heater core circuit while running stop leak? I'd rather not have to rig an assembly if hoses/connectors but understand that might be the only way 

I'm leaning toward the last option, but I'm also fearful that resolving this leak will only allow the next weakest point the opportunity to leak &amp; that might be a more critical location.

However if I put the car in park and shut the car off and try to turn it back on a few seconds later there engine doesn't start but all the electronics turn on.

It only happens if I try and turn the engine back on shortly after it's already been on. If I wait like 5-10 seconds it turns on fine. I assume this is to protect the engine from putting fuel in the pistons and turning off again. I assume if this happens there should be left over fuel in there and that wouldn't be good for the engine.

For me, it is the Jaguar F-Type.

But seeing some F-Type on the road, every time they just look pretty special, something about that retro-like long bonnet and almost rear-wheel seated cabin.

Can the popularity of SUVs/crossovers in the production car market threaten the future of production car racing, especially on lower end of the racing ladder?

[You could lower the crossovers to a regular hatch level like Toyota did with their C-HR for 24h Nurburgring](https://mag.toyota.co.uk/toyota-c-hr-racing-emerges-from-its-nurburgring-debut/), but that makes them lose what makes a crossover such, and validates the criticism of them as jacked-up hatchbacks.

A study conducted by Transport &amp; Environment concluded that on average, in Europe, an EV emits 63% less of CO2 emissions of an equivalent ICE vehicle over their lifetime.

The study took into account: the production of the cars (including the battery, engines, body, ...); production of electricity (wind, solar, geothermal, gas, coal, ...); extraction, processing, transportation and refining of gasoline and diesel; electricity losses; different lifetime mileage acording to different vehicles types (from 170k km to 500k km).

A very interesting conclusion is that the worst case scenario, when an EV is produced in China and used in Poland (mostly coal generated electricity), the EV emits on average 25% less CO2.

Best case scenario, an EV built and driven in Sweden emits 80% less CO2.

"My car was running just fine this morning when driving to work, didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. Then, while I was sitting at a red light, the light turned green so I put my foot on the gas and the car just whirred like it was in neutral (it was in drive). 



So I tried putting it into neutral, then back into drive and that did nothing. So I put it in park, turned the whole car off and back on, then put it into drive and it clicked and I was able to park at my work.



When starting it up again to leave, I could no longer even get it to go into reverse or drive and so now my car is stuck at work until I get it towed to a shop tomorrow morning. The car turns on just fine, no problems there. It just won't shift and just makes a loud ""whirring"" sound no matter what gear I try.

"I paid the $49 fee to post my used car on Autotrader two days ago, and I am seriously regretting wasting the money. I have been inundated with scammers from day one.

Most obvious scammer is the person who says they are out of state or out of country, they are ready to pay (via less secure method, of course), and once the payment is cleared, their mover will come pick up the vehicle. (Lame.)

Less obvious scammer is the individual who asks, 

&gt;When can i come see it? And can you please share its GAR report with me?  

So apparently this “GAR report” is a VIN report. The scammer further states,

&gt;please get the GAR its like $10 from vincheck.gr8.com and just don’t use  the venmo or paypal option as the GAR will arrive slower  

I ask if a Carfax report would suffice instead and he responded,

&gt; don't really trust them as i had a few bad experiences with them if you can get the GAR that'd be great  

Yeah, okay. Carfax suffices for everyone. It is the standard for used car sales. But he would rather me obtain a report from some obscure site. I pay the site, provide him with the report, and then he’s suddenly not interested for whatever reason. The site gets the money; he profits. Why? Because he obviously works for the site, hence the reason he is pushing me to obtain the report only from that site. Carfax just isn’t good enough for him, although it is for everyone else. Admittedly, he almost got me. However, because of the amount of scammers from whom I received messages, I realized he too was a scammer.  


My hunch was confirmed by this:

"Back in December, I sold my previous car to Carmax. It was a 2018 Honda Civic LX sedan, a very plain and basic car. I sold it to Carmax because they were willing to give me $19,000 which is more than what I paid for my Civic 3.5 years ago (bought it for $18,700 in February 2018) and I wanted to put it towards a new Ford Maverick. Originally my local Ford dealer said it would be a 8-10 week wait and I figured I could get by borrowing cars from my parents until then. Now they’re telling me it could be as long as 6 months until I get my Maverick, and I’m not sure I can get by without a car for myself. My parents don’t mind that I’m borrowing their cars, but it is annoying if I want to go out I basically have to play along with their schedules, jobs, etc.

"Hello, i recently purchased a car, and it's my first car I've owned with a manual transmission. I've driven manual cars and bikes a bit before, but I'm mostly teaching myself. I know that's probably not recommended, but here we are. Mostly it's been going well, I've found some good youtube videos that have helped me out and i've been driving around successfully enough.

one question I have is in first gear, after I've completely let out the clutch, it feels very sensitive to gas and braking. Like if I drive around 10 mph or so, and the revs are around 2500 or so, and I take my foot off the gas, it will be a pretty drastic slow down and maybe jerking involved. I assume this is due to engine braking being the most significant in first gear. But sometimes when I add gas again, it can be pretty jerky and not smooth. Is this normal, or is there something wrong with the transmission?? in the other gears it feels very smooth. If there's an issue, its usually changing gears or moving from park in first gear, but I feel that's me messing up the timing with the bite point of something. In all the other gears, if my foot is completely off the clutch, it feels fine. Only in first gear does it feel bad.

I saw this reaction in r/4Runner most recently and it’s something I’ve heard constantly from people who I wouldn’t ever describe as being “car people.” It seems like a lot of current 4Runner owners wouldn’t be caught dead in an “unreliable” turbocharged 4Runner if it does indeed get a 4cyl turbo motor in the coming generation. It’s not even a “no replacement for displacement,” argument, which of course boost is that replacement. Thinking back I’ve heard it again and again throughout the years to stay away from anything with a turbo. My guess is they or someone they know didn’t take care of their car, and blamed the turbo instead of their lack of maintenance.

" 

I'm currently in the middle of an engine swap from my old engine which threw a rod, i've done this swap before with the old 2v to a 2009 crown vic 2v which just recently threw a rod.

I've always done maintenance on my vehicles so i know it's very very important.

I'm swapping to a 93 lincoln mark viii 32V engine in my 1997 mustang GT, almost done with everything, just about to install into the vehicle and wanted to compression test while it was cold to ensure it was holding compression. (Engine has been sitting in a warehouse since 2006! w around 100k on it) dropped oil pan previously and everything looked great, no rust and cylinder walls looked clean.

I started compression test outside engine and cranked on starter for maybe 4 or 5 seconds before realizing i forgot to put oil in the engine (Big oops)

After putting in the oil it compression tested great, held between 160 - 180 on each cylinder. 

I'm just extremely worried that maybe i damaged something by cranking on it first without oil?? I put in a capful marvel mystery oil in each cylinder prior to the compression test and prior to putting oil in so it has SOME oil lubricating the pistons.

"The times between late 1940 to early 1990, when did automobiles start to lose their bright touch? Or when did Hybrid cars become more modern and the norm these days?

Often times classic cars are refered to cars between I'd say 1900 and 1960. So how come in let's say between 1950 and 1970, how did cars come to be so colorful and adequate. It gives off a distinct nostalgic feeling. Cars from those times are very different from the times now. Cars were like a mix of modern and 1950s space ship design

In the 1970s and 1990s, cars became more slick and laid back. It still retained the elements of the earlier years, but way more safer as cars were not well adjusted. We had some pretty famous and popular designs. Notably the Delorean of which gained lots of attention from BTTF. And not to mentioned in 2001 the iconic Dodge Charger

But so forth in the 2000s, cars started to lose their special touch to them. So I ask, what happen that made cars unique in their past generations? I'd like to hear your opinion",What happened to vibrant cars and garages? When did cars become more streamline?,1.0,cars,MrHuxo_syllabus,True

Example: most RS Audis (Quattro) will beat M BMWs from a dig, but after the bimmer gets traction, it destroys the Audi (0-100 vs 100-200). This happens in every level of high performance cars: Lamborghini vs McLaren, Bugatti vs Koenigsegg, etc.

I can't let it run underground due to the C02 and I don't have an outlet to plug a trickle charger.

So I thought I'd hook up a battery booster to the battery and start it that way to ensure it fires up right away and put less stress on the car that'll struggle trying to start a weak battery.

"My car has been snowed in for 2 weeks.  It does have a battery that's only a few months old and during its last service visit (Dec 15), they said it tested very strong.  I can't safely drive it in the snow so it sits.  I don't have access to an outlet to plug a trickle charger.  

So I won't be able to attempt to start it until week 3 at the earliest.  By then the battery will likely be quite run down, and I don't know if it'll start the car.

Because it's a push-button start, last time the battery failed, the ignition was trying to turn the car over on the weak battery for a long-ass time and I can't just turn the key the other way to stop it.

So I was thinking to pop the hood, hook up my battery  boost pack, and start the car off the booster, even if the car has enough juice to run on its own power, just to avoid putting the strain on the weak battery and the starter.

**Would winglets be effective on a car rear wing** if regulations didn't have to be adhered to?

Aero is not my forte, so bear with me while I run through my thought process, cos there's likely some inaccuracies.

Modern airliners often have winglets, something like this [https://i.stack.imgur.com/0MGzG.jpg](https://i.stack.imgur.com/0MGzG.jpg)

They come in many different styles, but looing at this type, they extend both up + down, are angled outwards, and swept back.

As far as I understand, their purpose is to prevent high pressure air escaping, reduce drag, and add lift.

Now, wings are aerofoils, which create lift, flip em around and you get negative lift, or downforce, which cars use to stick the the road.

So, if the principals are the same, why don't cars use winglets on their rear wings, but instead opt for endplates?

From what I can gather, in motorsport applications, various regulations on aero are the determining factor.

I.e. Since you are restricted on height / width etc, it's optimal to just run the widest wing you can, as high as you can. Winglets would eat into your available height / width and the trade off is less beneficial.

As such, cars run typically flat end plates that just fill what space they can.

However, that doesn't necessarily explain the end plate shape on cars. Typically they are pretty rectangular, maybe with a corner lopped off, and if you look at something like Gobstopper 2 the end plates are actually swept forward, the reverse of what you see on planes. Does this provide more downforce at the expense of increased drag?

[https://rogerclarkmotorsport.co.uk/uploads/pages/2000x750/61691a1121.jpg](https://rogerclarkmotorsport.co.uk/uploads/pages/2000x750/61691a1121.jpg[/img])

You do find winglets on some canards? So what's the about?

[https://www.motorbiscuit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/canarads-2-amazon.jpg](https://www.motorbiscuit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/canarads-2-amazon.jpg[/img])

The only real example I could find on rear wings are for rally applications, but that seems to be more of a sideways thing?

[https://wrcwings.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/alqassimi-wing-signed.jpg](https://wrcwings.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/alqassimi-wing-signed.jpg[/img])

**So, why do you never see winglets on unregulated track car rear wings? The only reason left I can think of is that the reduction in drag is so negligible at the comparatively low speeds cars travel at and the end plate designs we have prioritise downforce instead?**

Any ideas?

First the issues was normal like replacing your break pads or getting a oil change. Next I was having wiring issues. My car start having this random shaking motion. Mechanic said it was wiring issues and that issue went away after getting it fix. 3 months later I had to get my tire rod replace. Then a month later my thermostat housing needed to be replace. And now literally at this moment I’m already noticing other issue. My car has this jerking motion when I accelerate. I’m very irritated and I can’t afford to get my car fix again. I’m trying to figure out should I try and replace it. I just want a reliable car. Just normal issues with it and that’s it. These issues come every 3 months. I’m not sure what to do.

"Hi! I’m an aspiring car reviewer, been a Honda fanboy ever since I got my first car. I had a 2004 Honda Accord that I drove all throughout high school that really made me a Honda fan. I went through so much with that car. Made so many memories. So, it’s natural that I’ve been in love with Hondas ever since! I have a buddy who works at my local dealership and he allowed me to borrow a 22 Civic Sport for a few hours. Here are my thoughts!

I drove it off the lot with 13 miles on the odometer, so I was obviously incredibly nervous. I had never driven such a new car before. First impressions: great build quality. Everything fit together really nicely, with soft-touch plastic and faux carbon in most places on the interior. I love the redesign of the car, in my opinion this is one of the sexiest Civic models ever. Love the futuristic design of the front paired with the LED running lights and turn signals. It’s a very cute yet cool look. The car was finished in the white paint with black mirrors and black alloy wheels with chrome badges. 

Driving wise: I think the 2021 was a little faster, but I don’t think the 22 had been broken in yet, because as I said, it only had 13 miles on the odometer. Handling was amazing. It was tight and felt amazing around every corner. Acceleration wise, I don’t know if the model I had had a turbo like the 21 does, but it felt a little sluggish in comparison. However, the technology totally made up for it. A lot of features like standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a 7-inch digital gauge cluster, and a very responsive center screen. I also love the piano black around the singular air vent that runs the length of the dash. A very cool look. Also all for an amazing value! The one I drove was priced just under $25k.

"Born without a choice to a world of seemingly senseless death and misery, and disappointed by the lackluster education systems of all our countries that failed to notice our potential – that’s what I see when I look at the automotive community. We tell ourselves to avoid bringing politics, or discussion of ethnic differences, or economics into it because it’s our escape from it, but I say that’s a mistake. These are the elements that comprise the automotive community in the first place. From the glory of the 24 Hours of LeMans to the takeovers in Oakland, and from F1 to the Wangan racers of Tokyo; Moscow’s daredevils modifying their Bugattis and GTRs to bury their speedometer way past the 400kph mark, and St. Petersburg’s drifters dancing under the lights of a city that once brought tears to the young and impressionable eyes of this writer. The Georgian street racers still proudly representing OOM-500, and the Tsukuba lap-record holders who put everything on the lie for that sub-50 mark. Despite the differences in our ethnic backgrounds, gender identities, socio-economic conditions – we use cars to drive ourselves forward as humans because the alternative options presented to us are irrational. 

We find it to be more rational to jump our modified Cherokees with fuel cells hanging out the back through muddy terrain risking death, than to harm another for a lie we were fed by a government that claims our neighbor is our enemy with no proper explanation. It’s more rational for us to drive through a rainy canyon with our friends than to hold a tool of destruction to be used for its intended purpose. Some of our cars bear the flags of our nations just as proudly as the generals ordering drone strikes on lonely vehicles transporting medics to a hotzone, and it doesn’t take a genius to see why the former seems more appealing to the children of a generation that glorified hatred and war. 

You might think that a donked out Cadillac looks stupid, but I'd rather look stupid in style driving a donked out Cadillac than be behind the wheel of a tank about to be sent to multiple geographic positions by a drone. No matter how stupid the world may think we are, it does not compare to how stupid we think the world is with its ridiculous obsession with self-destruction. I’d rather get hit by the quarter panel of a white dodge Charger in Vallejo driven by someone equally desperate to live life differently than what we were taught to do. Better that than getting hit by a barrage of bullets from a helicopter while covering myself with the carcasses of those who once had names and dreams. 

We push our pain further away with each revolution of the engine or the motor propelling our machines towards what we claim to be that last lap, or the last slide, or the last jump. That last goal is a lie, a fabrication that allows us to continue with our seemingly senseless modifications to otherwise perfectly good cars. We do it because we want to feel control, see change made, see that we as humans have potential to improve upon our own lives – that’s what this passion represents. It’s for everyone who can afford it, but it’s comprised mainly by those who can’t. We drain our wallets because it’s more sensible than emptying our clips on someone our age, who has the same dreams, and who probably wants the same simple things in life. 

At a certain speed, we reach a sound of silence that comes at a point where we relinquish control, knowing full well that despite how well-honed our abilities are, this moment is not to be controlled, but to be enjoyed. That’s the moment we race towards – not against each other, but with each other – that moment of tranquil powerlessness at speeds that could splatter us like bugs on a windshield. We know this, and at that exact moment – if that happened despite our best efforts to prevent it – we wouldn’t mind. You might say ‘well that’s a stupid reason to die’ – name me one that isn’t. We would rather choose our preferred method of death, and then fall in love with it like the desperate morons that we are knowing that at the very least, we are not destroying the world, but maybe even making it a little bit better. You’re the same, aren’t you? 

*Afterword*: Every single person in this world is capable of finishing this sentence better than I ever could given the tools, time, and the environment necessary for it. I came to this realization not behind the keyboard, but behind the wheel – my comfort zone. It’s where I made a lot of mistakes, but it’s also where I learned far more than I could ever materialize. Many can only dream of a comfort zone like mine, and I choose to own it. I do not feel bad for having it because I have an idea of what it’s like to wish for it.

My apologies if this is not the best subreddit for this - didnt get much traction in the tahoe specific forum. I have a 2021 tahoe 5.3 and want to put a catback on it and had a few questions. Totally new to making any modifications to a vehicle.

-Is Gibson a respected name? I see they have their extreme exhaust about half off which is pretty enticing. I watched some youtube videos and it sounds great. Link here:

https://gibsonperformance.com/i-23267846-2021-tahoeyukon-5-3l-dual-extreme-exhaust-stainless-65683.html

-they claim 15-20 horsepower gains, is that realistic? Strikes me as unlikely.

-if not Gibson, any others that have a good reputation? They offer borla right on the gm website but it costs twice as much.

-are there any other components that i am required to swap if i do a catback? I know a CAI is reccomended but is anything really mandatory?

"I am really lost on what to do here.  The transmission light came on in my automatic six speed jeep patriot that only has 53,000 miles on it.  I took it to a transmission shop and they charged me $220 for a diagnostic and told me that there was loose metal inside the transmission.  They now say I need to pay another $1000 so they can take the transmission out of the engine and look at it to see if it can be repaired ( this would cost$1500) or it needs to be rebuilt which will cost an additional $4800.

  I only bought the car a year ago at a used car dealership for $8995 and I have barely put 3000 miles on it as I don't drive far.  They didn't tell me it had been in an accident which I am wondering caused the loose metal in the transmission at at such a low mileage and I still owe $7000 on the car.  Plus, without the potential transmission issue it would be valued at $11,000.  I am not the sharpest tool in the shed when it comes to making wise choices with automobiles here and this one is really killing me here.  

Questions: is it normal to charge a $1000 to take a transmission out and not put that towards the cost of a rebuild?  That sounds like a huge financial gamble.  What would a dealership do if I try to trade it in and get another car?  It is still running, it has very low mileage and it's in cosmetically excellent condition and the only reason I took it to the shop was because the transmission light came on.  Should I go to somewhere like Aamco or Firestone and just tell them to rebuild the transmission and hope I get a lower price or if I bought  a used transmission off eBay, would a mobile mechanic come out and install it for me?

"Basically I bought a car about 90 days ago. In my state you have 45 days to register a vehicle. They told me they'd get me the title soon. 44 days in I went and asked them and they said that things were processing slowly and they'd get it to me soon. They gave me a dealer plate (a full blown hard version, not a paper plate) to use while I was waiting, but this doesn't help me if I get pulled over anymore. I've checked in a few times but it's been 90 days now since I purchased my vehicle. What should I do? 

 I found [this link that talks about someone else who dealt with something similar](https://ficoforums.myfico.com/t5/SmorgasBoard/Dealer-sold-me-a-car-they-don-t-have-a-title-for/td-p/5076440) and plan on trying to take similar steps to get this resolved, but any insights and help would be much appreciated.

Additionally 

1. Does anyone know the laws on driving on a dealer plate? Everywhere I've read I'm under the impression they only last for the first 45 days after purchase and I actually could get fined for driving with what I have now? Is this correct?
2. What's my best course of action? I've actually gone to BBB and the link I posted said contact the attorney general.
3. They didn't have the title or provide it by the date they said they would. They told me I'd receive the title over 2 months ago and I've contacted them 3 times since then to resolve this before going to the BBB and coming to reddit.

I have a Tacoma 2007 4 CYL 2.4L engine and my head gasket blew out. On the road, 1,000 miles from home. First it was the radiator, so I brought it to the shop and they let me know the head gasket was blown. I drove the truck with the gauge on red until it absolutely gave out on me as I was taking the exit ramp. So now I’m stuck. I have not a clue about cars and don’t know if I should just sell the truck while I’m here or get the head gasket replaced. 

The thing is, how would I know if it’s as simple as a head gasket replacement? How do I know I didn’t run the engine to shit, thus destroying other components? The truck only had 117,000 miles on it. It is in perfect shape otherwise. I don’t know why this is happening to me.. anyhow..

He has been watching his business, print, die a slow death and decided to put together his own magazine bringing back the idea of the two page spread, for which it is named.

My 2015 Ram has been giving me some trouble lately, and I'm looking for some insight before inevitably take it in to the mechanic.

My truck had been sitting for 5 months or so because I was unable to drive it for a period of time. When I was finally able to drive it again, I wasn't shocked to find it unable to start. So I took out the battery and charged it for a day. Put it back in, still nothing. A mechanic I work with told me the battery is scrap, so I bought a new one. After installing the new one the truck roared to life to my delight; drove it for 3-4 days without any issues. On the last day, my girlfriend had been using it all day, and had to park on the side of the road with the 4-ways on because our drive way was too slippery for her to get up. Anyway, when I went to go turn the car back on it wouldn't start for me, so I boosted it with my the spare vehicle I'd been using, and it started back up again, even turned it off for a short bit and it still turned on. My girlfriend goes to use it the next day and it wont start again, so I borrow a charger from work and charge the new battery for \~10 hours, the truck wont start, wont even try to turn over without a boost. The mechanic from work told me it's probably the alternator and to try disconnecting the battery while truck is running, and if the truck sputters off, it's probably the alternator. Just did that 30 minutes ago and the truck continued to run with the battery disconnected. So now I'm stuck, and just wanna know what could be the problem before I shut 'er down and I drag it to the mechanic.

Side Note: I noticed the night it started giving me trouble, and tonight as well, that my headlights and my hood light would kinda brighten and dim slightly while the truck sat idling.

Any insight is greatly appreciated. Thank you",2015 Ram 1500 Sport Trouble Starting without Boost,1.0,cars,Koothbert,True

"Greetings,
I drive a 2006 or 2008 Ford C-max with a Diesel Engine. Lately i have struggled with an occasionally occurring problem, which is that sometimes while driving the engine just turns off. The Engine doesn’t always start right away after the problem occurs but after a minute of waiting it usually starts again, but as soon as you start driving it it turns off after a couple hundred feet. I went to a Ford garage to get it fixed, they promised me that it is the fuel filter and changed it, but with no results. I went to a different garage and they forced the failure a couple times and tried to read out the fault memory, but they still couldn’t find out whats wrong with my car so they eventually called Ford and asked for help, they told them to remove the exhaust gas control system plug and to plug it back in. After that it did work for a few weeks but now the problem has reoccurred. It seems to be some type of problem with the electronics which regulate the air-fuel-mixture since just before the engine turns off the car starts to jerk because it looses acceleration, then runs normal for a few seconds, then looses acceleration again, then runs normal for a few seconds. This cycle repeats itself a few times until the engine eventually turns off. I hope someone may know how to fix this. I hope this post doesn’t get deleted instantly because i couldn’t go into detail about Model,make and year but i cant find my papers at the moment",Ford C-max occasionally turns off while driving,1.0,cars,Oletti_6,True

"The issue:

On flat ground, when the car was started, it would bounce the revs from idle (~800) to as high as 3.5k like a vROOoom-vROOoom on repeat. As if I kept pumping the pedal with my foot. Before this very concerning situation, occasionally, it would fail to start back up when it turns off the engine at a stop light, and I'd have to fully turn off the car and restart it with the push button. It would never give issues while I'm driving or give any obvious gear shifting issues while it had this start-up problem leading up to the parked idle problem. Only once, it seemed to stall out as I reversed it down the driveway, but once the engine was on the downhill instead of the trunk, it started with no stalling.

So, after the parked idle issue, we took it to the service center for repair. These are the items of service they performed and replaced:

* Performing vehicle test
* Replacing alternator drive belt tensioner
* Replacement vehicle battery registering battery replacement
* Programming and coding control units including deleting fault memories
* Ribbed v-belt B11.28.7.618.848
* Original BMW B11.21.7.604.808

It has been hardly two weeks since we got the car back, and now I'm experiencing an issue where the car is shaking at idle and only stops shaking on the road when the RPM's are over 2.5k.

I have my guess as to what the problem is, but I don't want to color people's opinions about what the issue could be.

I was about 30km away from my cottage when the car started shaking violently. The shaking would be worst when accelerating. Soon after, the check engine, break and traction control lights all came on. The heating turned itself off on its own (which wasn’t great at -20)

I made it back to my cottage, checked under the hood, and none of the engine belts seemed to be broken. The exhaust pipe would be shaking violently even while the car was idling.

A few years ago when dropping my car off for service at night, my girlfriend picked me up in her early 2000's Dakota.  I offered to drive and she said yes.  Very clean, good shape truck with the 4.7 V8.  I loved the higher up seating position.  I loved the effortless way the engine responded to input when it was empty and roared ahead.  I loved the visibility of being able to see the tailgate and ironically finding it easier to park than a sedan.  I loved randomly using it to haul stuff when needed.  I love how rugged it felt. 
So I wanted one - but I have no use for one whatsoever.

I very seldom would use the bed.  I don't off road except for a couple small trips that a CUV could do.  I don't own a house, I live in a condo and most stuff can be carried in my car's trunk.
 Except I just enjoy the way a compact or midsize pickup truck drives.  A few years ago, I was cross shopping a Colorado Z71 and a Tacoma TRD Off-Road.  Now the Ranger is out too  (though it doesn't tickle my fancy as much, it's still a nice looking truck).  Something about the potential capability.  But also the effortless way they drive.  Being higher up and having a better feeling of the four corners of the vehicle.  

So yeah, I want one but I will admit I have absolutely no use for one.   But then again I don't need a 400+ horsepower V8 car when I could get by with 100 horsepower econobox, but I still like it.  I like being able to downshift and charge ahead and merge easily and feel the power and row through the box.

Somehow the crossovers and unibody trucks like the Maverick and the Ridgeline don't do it for me.  I like a smaller truck but with a real ladder frame.  To be capable of doing all the stuff I don't really need it to do.

"I need some help troubleshooting blue smoke coming out of my exhaust and if I run the engine for 10 min oil starts dripping out of the header. I need some help figuring out the tests I need to do to narrow down where the oil leak inside the engine is coming from.

I am not sure what caused this but I recently pulled a 350 SBC out of my 1975 Corvette (not the original engine). The stamps on the engine tell me it was built in 1977. I had it out of the car for about 8 months while we worked on the front suspension and engine bay to make everything look nice. We bought the car with the engine in it about 5 years ago so we decided to remove the oil pan and take the cam out just to see what we were working with while the engine was out of the car. Obviously to remove the cam we had to take the rocker arms off and remove the lifters. While doing this we kept track of which rocker arm and lifter came from which cylinder and whether it was exhaust or intake. We put each rocker arm in lifter back in its original place. We also replaced the timing chain and timing chain cover and we had the engine upside down for few weeks while replacing the oil pan.

Before pulling the engine out it would run good but not great, the idle always gave us trouble but it would start up with no issues and we were able to drive it no problems.

Once we had the engine back in we had no issue getting it started but it immediately started smoking. We figured maybe some oil got into the cylinders while the engine was upside down so we let it run for 20 or so min to see if the smoke would die down but it never did. We could see oil dripping from the passenger side header so we turned the car off and pulled it back in the garage. Once we moved the car we could see oil spray on the driveway where the passenger side header was. There was no visible smoke coming from the driver side and no visible oil on the driveway on the drivers side.

Once pulled back in the garage we removed the spark plugs and saw that the engine was running rich and a couple spark plugs from the passenger side had oil on them. We also removed the headers and stuck our fingers in the exhaust port and could feel oil on the exhaust valve in cylinder 2. We also ran a compression test and every cylinder tested between 140 and 150. We also attempted to remove the valve spring from the valve that we felt the oil on. We tried using an air compressor to hold the valve closed while we pressed down on the spring but even with 120 PSI of air pressure the valve would not stay closed. We also hear air flowing out of the cylinder while we had the air hooked up so we believe there wasn't actually any pressure in the cylinder to keep the valve closed.

Here is a list of engine specs:

\- Again this is a 350 SBC

\- 2 bolt mains

\- Chevy bowtie heads, 2.02 intake 1.60 exhaust.

\- We set the lash to .18 when reinstalling the rocker arms

\- We aren't sure the exact manufacturer of the cam but it was stamped with a CC on it, possibly a comp or crane cam.

We are not sure what caused the oil leak as it was not present before pulling the motor. We used cam break in grease on the cam and primed the oil pump before starting. We put an oil pressure gauge on the block to be sure we had oil pressure. Are there any other tests we can run to narrow down what the leak is before pulling the head off? Can we have a bad oil ring and still have good compression?

One other thing is the drivers side header do not get hot and 2 on passenger side they are warm to the touch. Any insight would be greatly appreciated.","1975 Corvette, 350 SBC blowing oil and smoke out of exhaust",1.0,cars,jawn3110,True

We are not sure what caused the oil leak as it was not present before pulling the motor. We used cam break in grease on the cam and primed the oil pump before starting. We put an oil pressure gauge on the block to be sure we had oil pressure. Are there any other tests we can run to narrow down what the leak is before pulling the head off? Can we have a bad oil ring and still have good compression?

One other thing is the drivers side header do not get hot and 2 on passenger side they are warm to the touch. Any insight would be greatly appreciated.",Need help troubleshooting,1.0,cars,jawn3110,True
