"Still at the research stage but but as I know next to nothing about motorcycles I was hoping some more experienced rides might be willing to share some wisdom.

What I think I know is the following :

You need a motorcycle license to legally ride it where I live - there are rider training courses available to improve / gain the skill required to ride safely (or more safely - used to riding a bicycle and you really need to watch the other traffic when on the road).

I'm leaning towards a Honda Super Cub 125 as I want to at least start on a full automatic bike (one less thing to think about while getting used to riding).

I'm going to need some gear so I have some protection when a crash happens so I have a chance to  walk away alive or at least not become a fatality statistic. 

As far as I can tell I'm going to want - at minimum - a helmet and It would be a good idea to get an armored jacket, pants and boots.

Looking at the estimated costs (generally a high estimate) I have found the following might be close:

Motorcycle itself: $6000.

Protective Clothing: $1,000 (Helmet + Jacket + Pants + Boots).

Registration: $320 per year.

Third Party Insurance: $150 per year.

Fuel: Approx $10 to fill the tank (good for at least 200Km) so say $20 per week and $1,040 per year.

Other consumables: ?

No idea of what an annual budget would be for other consumables - fuel is already accounted for, pretty sure the bike would need oil but not really sure about this bit.

Other considerations is the fact that I a fairly tall guy (approx 6 foot) and the bike will mostly be used around a city but occasionally on the highway (the top speed on the mentioned bike is just high enough for the highway at around 110Km/h but I doubt pushing the bike hard is going be good in the long run).",Help out a potential future rider out with some wisdom and advice please.,1.0,motorcycle,AussieBirb,True

\*\*THE STORY\*\*

&gt;!I'm on i4- west bound. Hit some traffic- lower the RPM's engine breaking, the bike stutters- acts like it's gonna die. I think ""oh no.. not this again"" last time this happened one of my cylinders exploded... So I ignore the Fi light \[always ignore blinking check engine lights kids..\] Stumble it down the exit ramp and pull over in a bicycle lane on a one way. Noticed the engine was hot to the touch - even with cold hands I could tell it's hotter then normal. so I let it sit there \[luckly today was in the lower 60s\] cracked open the fuse box made sure all the fuses were still good. Primed the fuel pump a few times \[key on an off\] Fi light still on holding the code. Finally after about 20mins of sitting- I start it up stumbles a few times idles a little wonky.
!&lt;

&gt;!rode down the road to get to a autoparts parking lot. Bike keeps stumbling at below 5k RPM will stay running above the 5k but stop and go traffic is KILLING me, so pull over in a large parking lot to let it cool down for a bit and to think on my issue some more. lift the fuel tank- wacked the fuel pump a few times with the back of my wrench. Borrowed a large screwdriver from a group of utility workers. Confirmed by ear my fuel pump was actually priming.. but was getting worse every time I ran it wanting to stay running, wouldn't idle without throttle. 
!&lt;

&gt;!Threw the choke on- to see if I could keep it on while I poked around each injector.. had a sweet GP idle with choke... \[does anyone even do the GP idle anymore?\] Sat down next to my bike, looked straight at my throttle bodies... one of the hoses for the FUCKING PAIR SYSTEM WAS PULLED OFF from a T nipple... Plugged it back up, let the throttle body sensor relearn.. and ran smoother, didn't wanna die. Still running a bit hot- there's no kink's in my fuel lines, so I know it a throttlebody/fuel issue. Ran all the way back home no stuttering/issues. had two little hick-ups I thought I felt. but super minor. !&lt;

  
TL:DR; bike dying out acting like it wasn't getting fuel. engine running hot. full tank of gas tho. PAIR vacuum hose was loose, plugged it back up. ran okay but still hot.

&amp;#x200B;

so here's what I got. Fuel pump \[oh 2000's fuel pumps.....\] Gonna find a gasket for it before I yoink it out and clean the ""uncleanable"" filter. \[it's actually cleanable just a PITA\] possibly pressure test it if I can find a tool that's fuel safe to do so.  


throttle body sync- I suspect they've come undone since the last time I did it when I got the bike 3 years ago. could explain the reason the engine is running hot. Also going to check the clutch adjustment. sometimes a dragging clutch/misadjustment will make the oil hot. I just changed the oil and filter 4 days ago- and checked my coolant levels in the morning before I left. so both those good. Fan also works.. If anyone in the central Florida area has a manometer I could use \[your work/house in the parking lot should take me like 45mins to sync\] I'd love you long time... I broke mine the last time I moved- should just buy another but a little short on $$ RN lol. I'll bring all my other tools to do it- and clean up after myself like I was never there..  


After those too, possibly a clogged/failing injector- she is still a 17 year old bike... \[damn sometimes I forget she's that old already!\]   


the bike is a daily rider for me, for the last almost 3 years. and this issue is only a MAX of 5 months old \[2 of those sitting waiting for an engine\] assuming their related at all...","""My motorcycle life is too easy and boring"" - Buy an early 2000s bike!",1.0,motorcycle,RidingEveryDay,True

I was riding getting use to everything around my small town 25 speed limit n as I shift to second gear coming off a turn at a light going 20mph, a truck literally last second gave me no reaction time failed to yield n jumped right in front of me I engaged my rear break first and then my front break which caused me to slide. Somehow through this i remember weaving n avoiding the truck not hitting him. But the momentum carried me ahead of my bike somersaulting. Luckily I was right in front of a restaurant where I got 3 witnesses claims saying the driver was at fault. The driver even apologized to me. I was so comfortable riding alittle test drive around this little small town not even planning on taking it over 40 I wasn‚Äôt wearing a helmet. Got banged up pretty good broke nothing buh nailed my head. Now I‚Äôm just frustrated about the bike n how it will play out with insurances if I‚Äôm not at fault but also got the bike same day.",Accident,1.0,motorcycle,Itchy-Confection-766,True

"So I've been having some trouble with my 2014 ZX6R. A couple weeks ago I rode it home from work ~Friday with no issues I noticed. Went to ride to work again the next Tuesday and it cranked fine but wouldn't start (I didn't touch it in between Friday and the following Tuesday).

I've since spent some time attempting to diagnose, here's what I've found:
- Confirmed spark by grounding out plugs on the block (orange? colour)
- Confirmed fuel. Can smell fuel around the throttle bodies after cranking and in the exhaust. Can hear the fuel pump run when I turn the ignition on and injector resistances were within spec (~12.1 ohms on all four). Tank is ~1/2 full and was filled around a week before it stopped running.

I don't believe compression should be an issue as I rode home fine and four days later wouldn't start (and I can feel air coming out the exhaust while cranking).

I'm beginning to run out of ideas here ‚Äì as a last ditch effort I changed the plugs as they needed to be changed anyway, confirmed a nice bright blue spark on these before installing and no luck. I've also tried a quick squirt of starter fluid down into each cylinder through the throttle bodies without any luck.

Keen to hear some other suggestions on what I can try.",ZX6R Cranking no start,1.0,motorcycle,a4e6b3e4,True

"Hey everyone, I came across a motorcycle (Suzuki Tu250) I have wanted but its located in Indiana. The seller seems legit, very responsive and the price is fair. I do want to know the process of getting a motorcycle from that far. I can't go and ride it back since I just got my license, but will hire someone to deliver the bike. My questions are:

1) Is pre-inspection recommended for peace of mind? Which companies have you folks used in the past? I don't know much about them so would prefer a professional to do this instead and give me a report.

2) The seller did mention that the motorcycle doesn't have front indicator lights. That's how he got the bike, and had no issues registering it in Indiana. Is that going to be a problem when doing  a safety inspection in the state of Maryland? 

3) As far as the title transfer goes, what do I need from the seller? Just the title signed at the back and a bill of sale? Since we can't meet in person, I am wondering what my options are.

4) For transferring money, would hiring an escrow company make sense? For safety of both of us?

I am looking for something affordable (means +/- 10k ‚Ç¨ without mods), which I could make look similar to these two (knucklehead/R18), or that even directly looks more **old** school.

Power ain't that important, as long as it can haul around 140/150 km/h without butchering the engine, I am more than happy with it, if it's less powerful but is looking just right, I will be happy too.  It could be even older bike, maintenance or the cost involving changing parts wouldn't be that horrible for me (family of mechanics).

Do you have any tips? the Price range is more or less fluent, if I have to spend some more on a bike I will absolutely love then I am going to do it, but the 15k is the max I could spend on a bike in the upcoming years.

I‚Äôve found a couple bikes that seem like they would fit in the middle such as the Aprilia rs660(although with the the price tag and problems they‚Äôve had i would rather wait a year or two to get it) and the r7 which seems over all pretty nice.

so, as we know, running lean isn't bad for the engine as long as it's not overheating.

&amp;#x200B;

a rich main jet and needle will make a high-performance engine run cooler, more fuel in the combustion chamber= more cooling. a bit like our bodies use sweat to cool down.

&amp;#x200B;

i wanna keep my idle circuit lean, because i like the popping from the exhaust when the mixture fails to ignite properly when the throttle is shut off so it ignites in the exhaust.

&amp;#x200B;

now let's make it clear, we're not talking extremely lean to the point where the bike isn't idling happily etc.

&amp;#x200B;

so, IMO, there is no danger doing so, as the IDLE circuit being rich isn't gonna provide any engine cooling anyway's as there is just too little fuel being delivered from the idle circuit. so we're not losing the advantage of better cooling that you have in a rich main jet and needle.

The Overdrive/Neutral switch on the gearbox is leaking oil and it needs to come out. I can get to it from the side, but it has a bulge and attached wires preventing me from putting a socket over it.

The only direction to get a wrench on it is from below, but that's where the exhaust collector sits. I really don't want to take it off.

I could do something with vicegrips, but I'm pretty sure the switch is going to break if I do that.
A new switch seems to be made out of unobtainium and a used one goes for well over ‚Ç¨100 and I'm not willing to pay that much for an almost 40y old switch that'll probably leak or start leaking soon.

Does anyone have an idea how to get the switch out undamaged and without removing the exhaust?
I'm pretty sure I can re-seal and re-use it. (worked for the oil pressure switch...)

If there's no way to get it out undamaged without removing the exhaust, and I have to break it, would the switch from an '85 Interceptor (VF500F, same engine) work? I understand it's a one-wire switch and will disable the OD light, which is fine by me.

"Hey everyone! I am in need of help.

I was at the track a few days ago and my I had no power after the first corner.

opened up the bike and saw the fuel injector fuse had blown which was the cause. However, after replacing the fuse, it starts and revs fine at a standstill, but once I got moving on the track, it blew again.

I unbolted the tank, started the bike with a new fuse, and started shaking all wires and the harness to simulate moving/vibrations, but it did not blow the fuse (somewhat elimating an open/broken wire)

I am leading to replacing the fuel pump, fuel filter and fuel strainer just in case theyre so old and clogged up which is causing the circuit to overload.

" 

I'm currently searching for my first bike and I'm interested in buying a z900. At first, it's not even one of my choices at first because of its excessive power unsuitable for beginners but I read that it has power modes that will restrict its power; specifically rain mode that will restrict its power to 60% (if I understand it correctly, z900 have 125hp power, but in rain mode, it will only have around 75hp) which is arguably suitable for beginners. I think that I can use it as safely as a beginner if I only use rain mode and I think I'm responsible enough to not go beyond my skills. I will probably only use it at full power mode after 5000miles of riding it at rain mode. And from my research, the power delivery of the z900 is smooth.

My other choices are CB650r, z650, Ninja 650, Triumph Trident 660, and MT-07. But the price of the z900 is at most only $1,500 more than my other choices, so I think that buying the z900 is more cost effective.

I also tried looking into 2nd hand but most are only $400-$500 cheaper than the brand new in my country.

" This question is specifically for Redditors in the UK and Europe.

I've heard that the Shoei NXR-2 is more of a long oval than the GT-Air-2, but I've also heard that it's more of a neutral shape (so more towards intermediate oval), so obviously I'm a bit confused by the conflicting information.

I was hoping someone here owns one and could share their opinion. I need a long oval helmet, but I live in the far east (Only round oval available here), meaning I'll have to buy online and get it shipped here. So, as far possible, I'd like to be certain of the NXR-2's shape.

"Hey everyone!

I've been wanting to get my license for a while now and finally have the time to do it!
The next problem is: which bike should I pick.

About me: 
Im quite tall (192 cm/6'3)
Based in Belgium
26 years old
Have some experience riding motorcycles in Vietnam

What Im looking for:
Type of bike: all round
Budget: 4k euros 
Preferably with ABS
Bike to ride for fun and some commuting. 
Occasional long trips troughout Europe.
A reliable bike with low maintenance

Bikes that are on my radar now:
- Transalp XL 700. I really like the looks a lot! Only downside might be the 5 gears instead of 6
- cb500x. Looks nice but a little small and is said to be a good beginner bike. Might lack a bit of punch and not sure if Im too tall.
- Vstrom 650: not many bad things to say about it. 
- Versys 650: don't really like the looks of it. Very positive reviews from owners.
- BMW 650F GS: don't know if its as realiable.

If you could give me some advice on this that would be great! Its pretty hard for a newcomer to make a good choice:)

"Hey everyone,

I got my first motorcycle recently.  It's a 2020 Kawasaki Vulcan S.  I've never done an oil change before, and I was doing my first one on this bike.

Long story short, I didn't thread the (new) oil filter onto the motorcycle correctly.

Within 2 minutes of having started the motorcycle, effectively all of the oil in the motorcycle leaked out.  Not sure how quickly it leaked out, and it definitely was not immediate.  I went and sat on the bike while it was running, and did not notice any oil leaking out.  That being said, it was pretty dark out, and it was only after I turned on my phone flash light that I noticed that the oil had completely left the motorcycle and I shut off the bike.

The low pressure oil warning (surprisingly) did not come on, and the engine did not cease.

"I wrecked my bike back in August. Came onto an exit going highway speeds and didn't see the turn coming. Thought it was a real lazy right hand turn i could cruise through but didn't see the little kink that tightened it up. Kind of a blind turn but what really f'd me was I looked back to change lanes and when I looked forward I realized I was pointing straight at the guardrail. Time slowed way down and I just kept thinking no way is this about to happen to me. My beautiful bike is about to get wrecked. Slammed the brakes and prayed I stopped in time. Add in a bit of target fixation and you get a nice splat.

Fortunately I was relatively unharmed. Was wearing my helmet and full armored jacket. Dislocated shoulder, stitches, mild concusion, and bumps and bruises. Worst is a partial tear and some nerve damage in my triceps. Doc says I should make a full recovery with PT tho. Exacerbated a previous neck injury as well but nothing too too serious. Doctor is hopefully. The impact knocked me out so idk what happened exactly. I remember hitting at like a 45 degree angle and hearing the crunch of plastics but nothing else until I got up. I came too laying face down in the middle of the road to some lady screaming OMG at the top of her lungs lol.

I'm still struggling to recover mentally though. Idk anytime I think about it I'm just so embarrassed and ashamed. Sucha rookie move (I've only been riding for about a year and a half but I thought myself better than this). My little brother rides too and i feel like I let him down. I know my family worries about me too. Ive told only my riding buddies so they knew I wasn't going to be around. Too embarrassed to even tell close friends that don't ride. Just don't want to deal with their judgement and the bullshit they'll say behind my back. I just feel so dumb for letting this happen to me and the woulda coulda shouldas haunt me. It was all my fault. Nobody to blame but this guy and I think that's why it stings so bad.

It's kind of sucked the joy out of riding for me too. I've been back on it a handful of times and it's still fun but it just feels different. I find excuses not to ride whereas before I'd find any excuse to ride my bike. I know time will help but idk man I just don't like to think about it. I'll be just sitting doing w.e and boop hey remember when u crashed ur bike that sucked. Ur an idiot lol. Those random thoughts prompted this post lol. I feel like I should be counting my blessing that me and the bike are ok knowing things could be worse and not dwelling on it but I'm stuck on it. I know people fair far worse than I did and I'm very thankful I was lucky that day and feel terribly for those who dont/didn't. 

If any of you have wrecked howd you deal with it mentally? I wanna keep riding I love my bike but I don't want to feel this way anymore. I certainly don't want to crash again either lol.

"The highlight of my year is the 2 week motorcycle vacation we take each year. We usually head to the Smoky Mountains and ride around the Tennessee, North Carolina and Georgia areas.

"I am needing to find info on lacing my own motorcycle rim, the denniskirk website brings up inflated tire diamters but I have not been able to find anything on rim ERD's to lace a rim to my own hub. 

I need a motorcycle rim to fit a certain area and we are probably talking 12"" motorcycle rim to 14"" motorcycle rim. As I had a 16"" rim once and it was to big. The hub I am lacing it to is custom and has 232mm hub flange diameter so I would like to fit a rim as close to that as possible but with the rims angled nipple holes I might not be able to do a radial 0x lacing job and might have to resort back to the customary 1x lacing pattern which puts the nipple angle into play which is customary for bicycle rims to have no more then 75 degree's or more, but never played around much with motorcycle rims before, just laced one once and I was off by a few mm on the spoke length do to the angle rim hole problem.

&amp;#x200B;

The next question is once you get to 12-14"" motorcycle rims for kids motorbikes what are the common rim widths?

I have a 18"" in 1.40"" wide for a custom build I was going to do.

"I'm about to buy a bike again after a 5 year break. Back then I had a 125 Yamaha YBR which was about 15 years or so old. Frankly, I felt like the clutch gave me more issues with that bike than I'd have liked to, though nothing was really wrong with it.

Was that just it being an older bike and thus being more difficult at times? I'm asking as I'm wondering whether the experience would be different if I buy a newer bike, say less than 5 years old? Totally undecided on the typo of bike too, I wouldn't mind a Yamaha YZF or an Aprilia RS 125.  Or even going towards the newer british bikes such as Bulitt, Herald  or Mutt Motorcycles. But given that I'm sick of not being able to get the bike in gear after it dies at a junction, I'm almost tempted to just get an automatic scooter instead.. what do you think?

"I never owned or drove a motorcycle before but I would like to learn and get my license first of course, but I want one because well I just think they are pretty cool and I am 22 btw.

Here are my concerns...

I don't grocery shop because I still live with parents...I know

I only go anywhere just for work or to buy cat food or snack or get something to eat or maybe go see a movie or go to the mall at times. I don't have any friends ( by choice) so I am not worried about driving anyone ( or should I say riding idk).

To go to work I go on a 70mph highway most of the way and then as I get close to work its about 55 40 mph roads and I don't know if that is a good idea for safety but like I guess that's something you already thought about before getting a bike. From work and back it will be about 50-56 miles total so I don't know how often I need to refuel.

I have no idea if motorcycle insurance is cheaper or more expensive compared to car insurance.

If I happen to get a girl friend or a friend will it be harder to ride the bike or about the same.

Do bikes have weight limits? Like If I buy cat food will I still be able to buy 10LB bags? Like will it make one side heavier or whatever. I don't know how the whole riding process works yet...

If it is very windy or rainy or both is it safe to ride to work still?

How often will I need to refuel if I ride for 50 miles a day?

Will the bike attract more cops?

Do helmets have speakers and mics in them for calls and music?

Should I worry if anyone tries to steal my bike and what should I do to prevent it at parking lots?

How do I learn to ride a bike before I go do my license test? I don't even know how the test even works or if they even teach you in there how to ride by showing you a bike and all that. 

I am not worried about needing a car for rare cases because I can just borrow one from my dads because he has 3 cars.

Sorry if I seem dumb I just know nothing about motorcycles other than different models and brands and that they are fun to drive I mean ride....

If there is anything else I should be concerned or know about let me know and any answers to my concerns would mean the world to me.",I am thinking of replacing my 2014 Honda Civic LX for a Honda Rebel 1100,1.0,motorcycle,RadUnicornn,True

"Hello! 

20E's here;

I have made the dire mistake of forgetting to tie up my bike during stormy weather and it fell over from a gust of wind and my clutch lever is now a nub. 

I did manage to swap it with a different lever for the time being, which is super short and not the most ideal, but it gets the job done. 

In the meanwhile, I have been looking at aftermarket clutch levers and have found surprisingly little information on choosing the correct one for my motorcycle.

Am I overthinking this, or is it really simple to just go online, pick a lever you like, then just install it and have it work nice, or is there something huge i'm missing, like pivot screw hole size, etc, etc.

I have a rare (ahem, part chinese) bike and used OEM parts are available, but I want to solve the problem in case it decides to try and do it's roll over trick again...

I am posting in desperation of some clarity, or that someone here could point me in the right direction :)

"Inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycle/comments/rxcphg/wonder_what_a_26k_theft_damage_repair_bill_look/) and the fact that my bike was also stolen a few weeks ago.

I live in a major city that has a semi high amount of crime (theft). With the pandemic, crime across the country (US) has increased. Vehicle crime has risen with the rest.

I had a 2012 Kawasaki 250R that was stolen in the middle of the night. It was recovered a few blocks away with some damage.

Insurance totaled it out, and wanted to pay me $3900 for the bike. However, my deductible for comprehensive was $1000 (the highest amount from my insurance), so I only got $2900. Basically missed out on 1/4 of the value of the bike!

Talking to the claims adjuster and a friend who used to work in insurance, they both advised me to decrease the deductible for motorcycles.

Getting a low deductible on your comprehensive coverage is much cheaper than getting a low deductible on your collision coverage. Maybe a few dollars per month. It hardly affected my premium for my new bike. I was dumb when I signed up for insurance and didn't understand what a lot of it did.

This morning, I needed to run a quick errand. Without even thinking, I hopped on the bike cuz that's how I get around town. Here's the kicker: I live on Chicago and we had 8"" of snow this weekend. I could see piles of snow and ice as I rolled out through the alley my garage opens up to. 

I briefly doubted the sanity of using a motorcycle today, but then easily friction-zoned my way out onto the main roads, which were perfectly clean and no different to ride.

On the way back, I turned into the alley (thankfully at like 5 mph) and immediately ate it. I'm not sure how, but I managed to land on my feet as my bike just dropped sadly onto a pile of ice and snow.

That wasn't half bad either. I just turned it off, picked it up, and rolled it to the garage. But... the entire 3'x12' incline that leads into my garage door was just a giant sloping sheet of ice. Couldn't get enough traction on my boots to walk the bike up. Couldn't get enough traction on the rear wheel to ride it up (dropped her another time trying). 

Got rescued by a random passerby who happened to have rope in the back of his truck. Ended up literally wrapping one end around the front shocks and hauling her up the icy slope.

The peg is around the center of my foot. I use rear brakes by pushing a little forward and down.

The problem is, due to my foot's weight, I realized that I have been braking even though there is no pressure applied by me.

When I found it out, I removed my foot completely to see if motorcycle goes faster and it did.

A friend suggested me to keep the front side of my foot on the peg and move it forward when I intend to rear-brake.

I don't like this idea because I don't think I will be able to react in time to anything.

I should also mention that I am tall (185cm, 6""1) and I have long legs.

I broke my ankle a few months ago on a motorcycle road trip (not bike related) so I had to leave one of my babies down in Texas.

It's obviously very cold out in the US right now but I am still riding up where I live. I have done shorter trips down to around 15 degrees and this was before I had heated gloves.

i have a question about this:

let's say we have 2 engines that are the same displacement (one might be a v2, the other a v4 whatever, let's just keep it simple for the sake of this question)

they both produce the same hp

one has more torque, the other revs higher.

now let's put them both in a car. let's take away traction, friction,clutch, final gear ratio and all that stuff away and let's pretend this is possible.

both cars will weight the exact same and have the exact same aereo dynamics

if they race,

which one will be faster? which one will accelerate faster?

now, if we were to put say, an extra 300-500 KG in both cars (passenger's, luggage)

if they would race again, would the outcome be exactly the same? (even if say, we add an extra ton or 2 to both cars, and pretend that the engine with less torque will have a clutch strong enough to let it reach the rpm where it has peak power, would the 2 cars still race the same?) **HP, torque, rpm....**",help me understand hp= torque x rpm,1.0,motorcycle,Gloomy_Breakfast_57,True

Also about a Honda grom if your maxing your engine everywhere doing 50-60 mph should you change the oil more often? Or is overstressing the engine only if your in the rev limiter all the time.

"Halfway through my license course and I'm getting into the excitements of thinking of deciding on my first bike.

After gone sitting on a few different ones in stores, I've concluded with a 98% certainty it's going to be the Honda 400X.

It's comfortable, sexy and good for city driving as well as long trips through the mountain roads. More importantly perhaps, it's not too small for a big guy.

It's a different type of bike from the Honda CB400 which I've been practicing on in my license course, but should be familiar enough.

"Hey guys, I'll try to make this short. Sorry if I've brought the mood down, but I could really use some help.

Recently a very close friend of mine passed away. Someone made a left turn in front of him. He had just bought his 2018 BMW S1000RR, and he was very proud of it, but he rode respectfully. I believe they calculated his speed at 40 ish MPH at point of impact, which they estimated would have put him traveling between 50 and 55 beforehand.

The impact happened just right, he died on the spot. No pain. The family was left in pieces. Eventually I pulled my panties up and was finally able to talk to them. One thing that came up was the eventual destination of his bike. I told them that no one can take that away from them, if they want it it's their no questions asked. But if they didn't want it, I didn't want it going to the insurance company and being scrapped. He was so proud of it and I just didn't want that.

Today the bike arrived. It's in my garage and it's just...bad. I think I'm in over my head, but I want to honor him, and I want HIS bike to see the road again. All electronics are toast, front wheel is shattered, exhaust manifold is smashed in, but the transmission still shifts and I'm guessing the motor is still good (no way to test). All of that would be livable...

Except that the forks snapped off the frame. And that broke me. I told myself as long as the frame is intact, it's still his bike. 

So now, I'm just looking for where to start. I need to know IF and HOW a frame can be welded back together (looks like die cast metal, I do t know that much about bikes, I work on cars but I own a Victory and do the maintenance on it).

I also need to know where to start looking for spare parts. Everything needs to be replaced. Dash cluster, hand controls, handlebars, the list goes on. Is there a community specific to BMW sport bikes that I should be in? Am I in the right place? Aside from going to junkyards, are the specific online or in-person stores I can go to?

The bike had around 150k miles after the odometer broke, but all components still work, carbs and radiator etc, everything is actually in good shape.

I was cleaning and checking around the bike, always noticed there are holes around the heads, although one had a screw, the middle one (the highlighted one) seems like it's missing a screw, although I'm not fully sure it needed one since we bought it, it never had a screw or a plug on it.

From the looks of it, it seems like it slowly leaked out liquids, although from touching it, seemed like oil, but only a small amount.

Is there supposed to a be a screw on it? I couldnt any find any further info around the web nor a engine manual to check out the part, does it matter or affect something?

Reading traffic (anticipating what drivers will do to prevent accidents)

Cornering Skill (faster and smoother cornering without losing traction)

Physics Instincts (knowledge of how far to lean before scraping, how fast to go to not lose traction)

Maintenance (chains, fluids, modifications, etc)

"So I got myself a CBR 500R 2016 with only 900 miles for a killer deal. The only problem with it is that the dash wasn't turning on, like I cannot see the gas/speed/ or even use high beam or honk the horn or turn signals, seems like a wiring issue. I went to the mechanic and it was just the wiring, a simple 5 minute fix.   


Couple of days go by and I start having this problem, I start my motorcycle fresh out the garage, it would drive like butter! Amazing, fast, shifts perfectly, nothing wrong! I would drive it 5 miles to the gym, park it outside in the shade. However, on the way home, the motorcycle randomly starts dying while I ride, such as when I crank the gas, nothing happens, the engine is still turned on however, but the gas doesn't work periodically, and randomly it would work again as I keep on cranking it. I found that hitting the kill switch on and off, would stop this from happening and I would get around 5 minutes before this problem happens again. When stopped at a traffic light and sitting in neutral, the motorcycle dies and on the dash I would see the Oil logo pop up, hence why I got an oil change, the shop said that the oil was wayyyy over filled, so I got it changed, and bam! Same problem as before!

  
So I did some experimenting. I found that once the motorcycle sits for over 5 or so hours or over night, it would be fresh and it would ride perfectly! However after I drive it and park it and then drive home, this random issue comes back. It is then that I found out this ONLY HAPPENS when it is hot outside, I am down here in Texas, and some days we have the temperature at 60s or sometimes even 50s. When it is cold outside, I can ride this bike for hours on end, park it, drive it, do anything and nothing would go wrong. However, when it is in the 70s or 80s or hotter and more humid days, this issue happens.  


What I have no clue about is why is it that when I turn the kill switch on and off I get 5 minutes of smooth riding. Also why is it that once the motorcycle is fresh from my house, it drives smoothly whether its cold or hot outside, the issue only happens on the way home.   


I took it to the mechanic they said there's rust in the tank, and they want $1500 for replacement and refuse to clean it, I call absolute bullshit, if its a gas to the engine issue then how come when its cold outside I dont have this issue, and if its gas to engine how come if i turn the kill switch on and off the bike randomly starts driving perfectly fine?

"So I‚Äôm still troubleshooting my 2008 gsx650f; the mechanics in my area have been booked for weeks, I‚Äôm on a call-list for all of them but one wants me to leave my bike at their shop to hold my place in line (which I can‚Äôt quite do as I need the bike for my commute).

The problem has been faulty acceleration. I crank the throttle, and the engine revs then dies and won‚Äôt go above 4-5k rpm. It‚Äôs a sport bike so it should be able to hold high revs easy.

I‚Äôve tried all the usual suspects: oil filter, oil change, spark plugs, air filter, and finally last night I replaced the EFI fuel pump and strainer (honestly this was easier than the spark plugs). 

As I‚Äôm following the youtube video to figure out how to do this, I realize that my bike doesn‚Äôt actually have a mesh strainer but still contains the plastic part where it would fit into the fuel pump assembly. I look in the gas tank-lo and behold, the fuel strainer is in pieces inside my gas tank. I use my grabber claw to fish the pieces I can see out of the gas tank, reassemble the bike with a new pump and strainer, take it up and down my street and I can finally hit 10k rpm! Success! Right?

Wrong. I fire it up this morning and I‚Äôm having the same goddamn issue-faulty acceleration.

I‚Äôm thinking that parts of the old strainer are gumming up the fuel line somehow, maybe they settled overnight. I‚Äôm still on a waitlist for the mechanics but thought I would try using some seafoam to clean out the fuel injector. Will this work? What other ideas can I try?

"So today was my first day of my riders course. I was having such a hard time with throttle control. The bikes were Honda Groms.
These bikes stall out if you release the clutch with no throttle. So they would tell us pull on the throttle a good amount and control speed with the clutch. 

I was having such a hard time controlling the speed and fell twice. It was tough because the bike had to go at a certain rpm to start moving and as soon as the clutch was eased off slowly and start catching the bike would take off, which caused me to freak out and lose control. 

Also, it felt like we were moving lessons so quickly I would barely have any time to practice. By the second hour they were telling us to shift gears, weave and do 90 degree turns. I've barely gotten a chance to work on moving forward and breaking.

Instructor took me to the side and told me if I fall again I will have to leave the course. Which I'm ok with and completely understand. It's a risk for me and the other riders. 

I don't have anything to practice on before tomorrow so I'm a little worried that same thing is going to happen and will have to embarrassingly leave the course.

"I am about to begin my motorcycle training in the new year. I have my eye on the Honda Rebel 500 as a first bike, it has the aesthetic I like, enough power, and not a bad price.

Now the question is, should I always seek to buy the newest version of the bike? The 2021/22 models have all LED lights and some minor upgrades.  I can also get one that's a few years older for half the price of a new one, but I don't know if I should always seek to buy the newest engine possible. The price isn't a big factor as I will likely pay half upfront and spread the rest of the cost out over a year or two.

"[crossposting here because the motorcycle**s** sub put my post into moderation queue. Thank you.]

I guess living in India it was only a matter of time.

I was stationary in a traffic jam and some idiot in his dumb SUV hit me from the side and I fell.

I'm not hurt (slight bruise on my leg) and the motorcycle seems to have zero cosmetic damage (I can't even say for sure where he hit me but I see some paint transfer on th exhaust).

However, when I tried to start it up after lifting it, it threw up a yellow triangle with an exclamation mark (it's a Suzuki) along. The odomoter also said _LO_ instead of the mileage. (see edit)

There was another symbol I forgot in the heat of the moment.

**The bike did not start on the first turn.** I switched off ignition and tried again 10 seconds later (no warnings tbis time) and it started normally.

I took off but when I downshifted I realized that the shifter was getting stuck in place (down) and if I didn't lift it into its normal middle position, it would fling back into place very harshly.

More importantly, I have never dealt with insurance and I recorded the car but my phone shat the bed  unfortunately the car fled. 

I have factory warranty and full coverage insurance so I am not sure how to go about it. I had already booked my service for tomorrow (only second service) and I'm not sure if I should tell the service centre that someone hit me (no cosmetic damage) and let warranty take care of everything.

The bike is a Suzuki Gixxer SF 250 (SEA market).

Anyway, that's it. I would really appreciate some help. 

P.S. It's a really strange, helpless feeling as the motorcycle falls down on one side and you can't do anything.

Edit: Regarding the warnings, I checked my user manual and it wasn't _LO_ but rather _TO_ referring to motorcycle tip over. It doesn't show anything now but I'm still worried about internal damage (especially due to the gear shifter).","[X-Post] Got hit for the first time, can someone tell me what's wrong with my bike now?",0.4,motorcycle,colinhomelite,True

When I got the bike I emptied the gas tank, got some fresh 91, cleaned out the fuel filter and replaced the battery. I took it for a ride and about 20 minutes in it died. I used a multi meter and determined the battery wasn‚Äôt charging so I ordered a 60 dollar stator/rectifier kit from eBay, I also brought a battery from eBay as well. At the time I was only able to replace the rectifier I ran the bike once or twice and then replaced the stator. Everything seemed good, but I didn‚Äôt test everything at that time. On a recent test I determined (using the multimeter) that the battery is still not charging while running. When I started the bike today it was at 11.85 volts and by the time I was done messing around with it the multi meter said it was 11.67.

" So,

I tried to take a picture but it's pointless you can't really tell anything from it.

After a blown head gasket and like 1,5 years of storage (thanks Covid) the tires on my bike look beaten up.

They were new back then (less than a year, Michelin pilot road 4) but after that long period of storage they look really tough / hard, there's no crack whatsoever but they look sAaad.

The bike was stored indoor but idk if it's the climate (always hot and crazy humidity) over here but a couple of years ago I had already stored my bike (former Pilot road 3 tires) for over 6 months and after driving it for the first time I almost crashed because they were really tough, they did kinda fully recover after like 100-200km but driving was ""interesting"" during that time (lost the rear that abruptly swung like if I had driven on ice, recovered with my lucky boot).

Okay so they're fucked right ? :D is there anything I can do to the Michelin god to ease his anger !?

"I will very soon be getting my first bike. I just completed my basic rider course.

So I was thinking of beginner bikes.
Choices, as I look around, seem to be:
- KTM 390 Duke
- KTM RC 390
- Yamaha r3
- Kawasaki Ninja 300/400
- CBR300
- Kawasaki Versys X 300
- MT-03
- Falcon 250


I will basically use it to commute 1 hr on the Highway and back. So 2 hr daily. Is it too much for these bikes? Do you think it‚Äôs comfortable for this long? I really have no other choice, for real.

As for the Falcon, the thing is that it‚Äôs cheap. That‚Äôs basically the point. Plus, I really need to practice a lot. I have never ridden before, beside the BRC.

I know all the other bikes are good on Highways, but‚Ä¶

Falconwise (if you have one):
- Have you ever taken it on the highway? How does it perform?
- I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù. Is it good for my height? And am 130lb, if the approximate top speed is 70, will it go faster cause I am light?
- What speed does it max out?

For the record, I am in AZ. Planning to maybe do some trips to the canyon, LV, LA, and San Diego. Then I‚Äôll be in South Dakota next year.

I know that the Falcon is automatic, don‚Äôt reiterate. I do want a manual. But for now I don‚Äôt care. Good thing at least I‚Äôll learn how to ride on a Highway and see how confortabile I am riding.

"First time rode a bike over 50cc. Below are just my notes for mine and possibly others benefit.
It was a grizzled old Honda CB400 at the driving school.

First thoughts are good. Once the instructor let me drive without him disturbing my sense of balance by holding onto the mirror, i felt much more confident with the weight and balance.

I need to remember to keep my left foot on top of the changer by default and not under it.

Remember to hold both breaks when fully stopped too.

Don't accelerate in too low of a gear as you'll look like a jerk jerking around. Go up a gear and the accelerate is much smoother. But got damn the handle is sensitive... Just like the changer when trying to go into neutral it kept shifting gear.

When stopping, shift down to first gear after breaking and only when stopping. In tight corners, second gear should be fine.

Cornering felt weird, as if the bike knew what i was doing and pushed the handle itself in that direction i was going. No problem, just a bit unexpected.

Remember the initialize sequence. HandBrake, stabilize, footpeg up, look back, sit down, right leg up, turn key, right leg down left leg up, shift to neutral, engine on, shift to first gear, left leg down right leg up, clutch half way with 1000-2000rpm and of you go.

My questions are: 

What is the bare minimum gear a beginner should get? (I heard mixed stuff regarding how important biker pants/gloves/specific biker boots instead of normal thick boots). I  am aware that a vest and a helmet are of utmost importance so I will be getting those. 

Also, what gear can I buy used to save myself some money? Some friends recommended that I buy everything used except for the helmet.",Bare minimum gear for beginners and what to buy used,1.0,motorcycle,CrunchyPy,True

"Last night I was lane splitting in San Francisco (legal) heading to the Bay Bridge during rush hour. Traffic was moving around 5-10 mph and I was moving at a modest vector of 5-10 mph beyond that, as the law says we should. 
Coming up between a box truck and an old Rav4, I noticed both vehicles were too close for comfort, so I started chopping my throttle (my horn is so wimpy you literally cannot hear it over my exhaust and other traffic noise). For added context I'm on a DR650, so I'm plenty tall enough for drivers to see, and my exhaust is significantly louder than stock. As I drew level with the truck and car, I realized neither of them were going to move out of the way. I slowed down as much as I could and tried to squeeze through, but my handlebar bumped the mirror of the RAV4. Of course the driver honked long and angry, and I just dipped. My rationale for leaving the scene was this: the most I could've damaged his mirror was a little scuff, and it just flipped out of the way. He could easily reach out the window to flip it back into place and continue. Had I stayed, we would have exchanged some words, held up traffic further, with me in an incredibly vulnerable position, and maybe he'd be enough of a dick to demand I replace his mirror. 

Am I the asshole? I do try to ride as though I am invisible, but when I drive cars I also keep my eyes peeled for riders and make sure they have plenty of room between lanes, as I believe all drivers should do. If the contact had been more severe I obviously would have stopped.

I also now work in the city centre, and there are advantages of using bus and bike lanes (a super quick way to move around the city), I can also park for free at work in the back yard (cars can't). Also, my older brother is a long time biker and it would be nice to go on rides with him.

So, first things first, any advice?

"A few months ago the RC8C was announced and I got to be one of the lucky 100 that was able to buy one in time. It sold out in something like 4 minutes and 32 seconds. To top it off, I was one of the 25 \*super\* lucky customers that was able to take part in the Track Delivery experience at Jerez, Spain.

Funny enough, this is my first KTM, but I've been a fan of their MotoGP team since it launched and last year's 2020 performance was just thrilling to watch. While watching Binder and Oliveira dominate in Styria last year, I told my girlfriend, ""As soon as KTM comes out with a sportbike, I'm going to get one!"" and a little over a year later I had the chance to do just that.

The whole experience was absolutely surreal, we arrived in Southern Spain via Houston -&gt; New York -&gt; Madrid -&gt; Jerez de la Frontera (nearly 24 hours of travel!). Took a cab to the hotel which is nestled in the hills besides the track. We arrived on a Wednesday evening and in the background we could hear the howling of a V4 MotoGP bike and I told my girlfriend that it was definitely Pedrosa doing test laps as he is a test rider for the KTM MotoGP team (he and Mika Kallio).

The next day, Thursday, we were brought to the track to observe testing. What that means is they put us in the pitbox above the garages and we were allowed to watch the KTM test riders run test laps with some new parts. What was extra special was Honda and Yamaha were both there as well so we got to see Honda's new 2022 MotoGP bike which looks amazing. Unfortunately, all of our phones/cameras were taped shut as it was highly confidential. Afterwards we had a nice welcome dinner at the flying saucer/UFO shaped reception/dining area directly above the track which was just beautiful and surreal. That was when we first met Dani and Mika in person and I have to say he was very approachable and easy to talk to. Exactly how I thought Dani would be in person. There was a little chit chat and we had our meals and went to get some rest.

Come Friday, they shuttled all of us over to the garages, had us wear our suits and took photos of all of us so that the photographer and videographer could identify us throughout the day. Then Markus Kramer and a KTM manager presented the RC8C without any fairings to talk through all the special parts and construction. I took a video of this presentation: [https://youtu.be/GcNOKY7UKzw](https://youtu.be/GcNOKY7UKzw). Afterwards, we were taken in front of our garage and the big reveal happened. The garage doors lifted and we were presented with 25 \*beautiful\* RC8Cs:

https://preview.redd.it/ygw5oovzaw081.jpg?width=5472&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ea2ac14a5334e5660e1a09a7bedfac18221d688

It was just an Incredible experience. It felt like every holiday gift bundled into a single moment. Just incredible.

One of the coolest things is that each RC8C is handbuilt and we were assigned our specific mechanic that built our bike for the day. They took care of everything for us and it was just so awesome to have that level of support just so you can enjoy your new motorcycle. I wish I had that at every track day!

Dani came around for photos:

And then off we went to the track!

Over the course of the morning I had been chatting a little bit with him and I like to think he saw how enthusiastic I was and eager to learn. So during the 2nd session I was behind him and he slowed down on the front straight, turned around, looked at me and let me pass by. I KNEW he was following me. So like an absolute IDIOT I started to push and...the short of it...is that I am the first person in the world to crash a RC8C. The bike never hit the ground, but I did run it off into the gravel pits and hit an air fence, so I still think it counts as a crash. Dani saw all of it. Hahahha.

But what happened afterwards was worth all of it. **Dani came by and checked on me and ended up giving me and the whole group a masterclass on body movement and mechanics**: [https://youtu.be/mE6gzImK460?t=56](https://youtu.be/mE6gzImK460?t=56).

We did 8 sessions that day and towards the end of the day Dani invited me and a friend to come ride with him, which was just surreal. It felt like a dream: [https://youtu.be/JlQJW1ncW1w](https://youtu.be/JlQJW1ncW1w). The best feeling I had was afterwards he told me I had improved on exactly the things that he suggested (minimizing neutral phase/idling in the saddle, particularly transitioning between turns 2 and 3). It all just felt like a dream.

Anyway, I'm starting to ramble, but I wanted to share this experience and I hope you guys and gals enjoyed it and I \*really\* really hope that the lesson with Dani is valuable to you as a rider.

If you have any questions about the RC8C or the experience, please let me know! This is my first real post on Reddit. Just wanted to share.

"I will preface this by saying that my opinion is only that, an opinion, and should not be taken as mechanical advice and I am not liable in anyway for the chain you should have replaced four seasons ago snapping in two when you stop lubricating it lol.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's begin with how modern O-Ring and X-ring chains are constructed. The links consist of two pins with a bushing and steel roller for each. Grease is sucked into the gap between the pin and bushing, O-rings or X-rings are then sandwiched between the pins and the plates, sealing the grease into the roller assembly. This roller assembly is then free to roll as it wishes onto the sprockets, reducing mechanical drag.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vz4au7cjqh081.jpg?width=645&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f82af59682a2d4f49f8e839c5b715422eecef90

From this illustration you can clearly see the grease sealed into the chain links. Any amount of external lubrication is not going to enter into the grease channel. This is why you are warned about using solvents on a sealed chain because it may break down the O-Ring material and wash out the grease inside. At that point you are well and truly boned, no amount of external lubrication will put grease back in between the pin and bushing.

&amp;#x200B;

WE ARE NEEDLESSLY SLINGING GREASE, OR WAX, OR WHATEVER ALL OVER OUR PRECIOUS BABIES! Let me bring you into the light brethren. You need not deal with the mess, you only need to wipe the chain clean after every ride. Grab a rag and soak it with WD-40 or any light oil of your choice, clean the chain, leaving a razor thin coating of oil to ward off oxidation and then REJOICE!!! you will never deal with the mess again!

"I have an 05' SV650S. New radiator in my motorcycle and I just finished doing the coolant. This is my first time ever doing a coolant change by myself.

Regarding the radiator, I made sure all 3 pipes that attached to it were fastened good with the clamps and the temp sensor &amp; fan connection were plugged in correctly. 

During the coolant change, I made sure to flush out all of the coolant using distilled water in both the reservoir and the pipes. Filled coolant to the top, squeezed pipes, shook bike back and forth and kept repeating that process to make sure air bubbles are out. Started the bike up and let it run for a few minutes.

All was well until I revved the bike once and the idle dropped down to around 700RPM (usually 1200). Didn't like the sound of that so I switched off the bike and remembered that I need to fill the reservoir as well. Filled it probably halfway between high and low. Turned on bike again and let it run; the idle was all fine now, even after revving. Not sure if that had any correlation. 

I made sure to finally top off the radiator and close the cap on it.

I took it on a test drive 20 minutes later to ensure that the bike didn't overheat and all was working properly. Went for an almost 10 minute driving cruising at around 4500RPM. I kept a watch on the temperature and it ranged from 76¬∞C-82¬∞C (168¬∞F-179¬∞F).

The outdoor temperature at the time was around freezing temp (0¬∞C/32¬∞F).

"I like the idea of wearing the dirt bike style armor in the open, especially in the summer when it's too hot to wear a full jacket. The issue I see is that all that armor is just kind of dull. What I want to try to do is make custom armor, themed if you will. My ideas are either a Havoc Trooper from the Star Wars Old Republic, Mandalorian style, or maybe just some post-apocalpytic. I have a few ideas on what could be done, but want to be told what sounds stupid and what might work. The main parts are the torso, shoulders, and arms. I'm not too worried about anything below the belly button, maybe working on some thigh armor in the future.

The first idea is running how stormtrooper armor works: You start with a base mesh layer, probably made of Kevlar or some other abrasion resistant material, making sure it's breathable, but not see-through. Then either velcro or sew on CE armor parts straight to the base mesh. From there, maybe attach pieces of ABS Thermoplastic custom printed and painted armor parts directly to the CE armor. My best guess is velcro for this.

The second idea is buying a full dirt bike jacket and essentially gluing/velcroing these ABS thermoplastics to the points I want. This would bypass the need to build from scratch, but would likely compromise the armor's abilities and the parts probably won't move as freely as they need to.

A third idea I had is to print out the ABS plastics first. All of the plastic components are then lined with EVA foam. Definitely not the best for protection, but still better than nothing. Same as before when it comes to attaching the parts, likely a base mesh jacket/lining what each part would be attached using velcro or sewing of some kind.

With the armor, it might be a possibility to look into straps for specific components like the torso and forearm components. Shoulders and upper arms could be simply attached to the torso.

*\*\*\*Again, this is just brainstorming, and maybe none of this works at all. Tear down all my ideas if they suck. Throw some ideas at me that you think would work. I prefer constructive criticism, but don't be afraid to be rough as armor is life and death.*",Any ideas for making custom motorcycle armor?,1.0,motorcycle,SlandersPete,True

So. I can't get it to turn over properly. The electric start fires up, but it never turns the engine up to an idle. It's almost there, but never quite. It's also drains the battery significantly, like within a minute or so of trying. So now I've just been trying to kick it to life, which also almost never succeeds. I've successfully kicked it to start a few times, only for it to idle roughly. Choke fully on, throttle a bit open, but always a bear to try and get to life. I was satisfied that I got that far. But then it would die almost immediately. Even fussing with the idle screw only helps for a few moments.


Here are the things I've tried:

I've changed the spark plugs, set the ignition timing, made sure the battery was good (Advanced Auto tested it, said it was okay), replaced the regulator/rectifier with one from Common Motor, had the carbs sent off to be rebuilt and cleaned completely (along with bench syncing), filled it up with fresh fuel, aaaaand...nothing.

I'm sure it's a simple fix, but I'm just not sure what I'm missing.

I just don‚Äôt see the point learning a manual when I‚Äôll be riding an automatic. All of the other courses out for free plus YouTube videos I personally feel like should be enough. My plan was to just get my permit and take it to an empty parking lot and practice there until I feel good enough to take it on the road. 

The reason I‚Äôm asking for advice is because I‚Äôve never ridden a motorcycle before so maybe I am just super ignorant. I spent most of my childhood riding bicycles so I can definitely ride and balance a bicycle. (I say that because I‚Äôve seen a lot of ppl ask that). 

I will be using this bike as mostly just a commute to work and don‚Äôt plan on acting crazy on it and I will 100% be buying gloves, boots, helmet and jacket. 

Please don‚Äôt flame me for buying a automatic. I live in the city and don‚Äôt know how to drive a manual car either and I don‚Äôt care to learn.

What is the best way to fix a tyre? This is a question that many people ask themselves when they get a flat tyre, because considering the [motorcycle tyre price in Sri Lanka](https://dsityreshop.com/product-category/motorcycle-tyres/), replacing them as soon as something small happen is not an answer. The answer depends on what type of repair you need and how much time you have to get it done. If you want an easy and quick solution, then plugs are your best option. They take less than ten minutes for installation and don't require any tools.

What is a plug type repair? A plug type tyre repair involves drilling holes into the damaged area of your tyre and then pushing metal ""plugs"" through them. The plugs seal the hole, and therefore prevent any air from leaking out. This method can be done on solid tyres as well as those with puncture proofing layers like Kevlar or steel belts.

A patch type tyre repair requires removing all of the rubber around where you need to make repairs (usually an inch surrounding each side of the hole). You would apply some special glue over top of that before putting down another layer of rubber cement and finally adding a piece of new rubber for protection around the area where you have repaired.

The plug type tyre repair is a quick and easy process, involving inserting an object called a ""plug"" into the hole in your tyre to seal it up from the inside out. The plugs are made of rubber which quickly expands when inserted through the puncture allowing for a tight fit that seals off leaks very well. They can also be used on solid tyres if you need to stop them from losing air before entering a service shop or tyre centre. In general, they're easier than patching because there is less work involved with making repairs.

In general, these repairs are done after an impact has caused damage which means you would need to remove all of that rubber from around where your plug or patches will be going because otherwise the glue wouldn't stick properly. However, it should be remembered that if the tyre damage is irreparable, then there is no other option than getting new [motorcycle tyres online in Sri Lanka](https://dsityreshop.com/product-category/motorcycle-tyres/), or through a supplier and replacing them.","Tyre Repair, Which Is Better?

"I've been a year-round commuter cyclist for many years now. Whenever I need to transport something very large or very heavy I hook up a trailer to my bike to haul cargo. This is extremely common in the world of cycling and no one seems to think twice about it.

I've been researching motorcycles as I'm thinking of getting one (or possibly an electric scooter, haven't decided yet) and was rather surprised when I started looking up motorcycle trailers. It was really hard to find any information on the subject, and what I found was laced with warnings like ""no manufacturer would ever recommend hooking up a trailer to your motorcycle"" and ""if you decide to do this you do it at your own risk"". This is a remarkable contrast from the world I'm coming from where the same manufacturer that sold me my bicycle frame, also sells trailers to use with it.

What is it about motorcycles that makes hauling a trailer with them so much more dangerous? I've heard warnings about how a really heavy trailer might throw off the balance of a lighter motorcycle. My bicycle is light enough that I can carry it in one arm up and down the stairs to my apartment, using my free arm to open doors along the way. Motorcycles can get upwards of 400 pounds. Personally I would be rather surprised to see any weight issues.

I suppose it could also be a speed thing, since motorcycles travel much faster than bicycles. If that's the issue though, couldn't you just ride slower when you have a trailer attached? It just seems silly to me that I can do something on my bicycle that a motorcycle would struggle with.",Why do so few motorcycles use trailers?,1.0,motorcycle,Ghost3141592,True

"I've always loved motorcycles. My dad rode. My cousin had dirt bikes as a kid that he would let me take up and down the street from time to time. I almost got one when I was 18 but my mom threatened to take me off her health care benefits if I did. 
  For nearly 2 decades I sat in jealously of seeing riders go by me. Dreaming of road trips and voyages, riding into sunsets and cruising to beaches. At 35 I finally did it. I saved up money, I took the class, I bought the gear, and I made an 07 Shadow 1100 with 12,xxx miles on it mine. Less miles for the price than any other bike in my area. She's not the fastest or most beautiful, but she's mine and I love her. 
   I have a great deal of depression, and anxiety. I've spent the last few years working on my mental health and in doing so dug up a lot of skeletons that I didn't know I had buried. I had a lot of things blocked out of memory that my coping mechanisms had kept from me. 
   5 years ago I would of told you that I had a rough childhood, wrong side of the tracks type things, nothing too out of the ordinary.  But revelations in my self re-discovery brought out memories of being raped, sexually, emotionally, psychologically abused, neglected. Things hidden behind alcohol, weed, and pills, that I was using way too much of. 
  Now I find myself under a near constant bombardment of invasive thoughts and memories. Overall I guess I'm glad that I was able to remember those things because now the depression and anxiety make sense, but now those same memories haunt me constantly and I struggle to find diversions from them. 
  She always finds a way, that Honda. To distract me from myself. Her rumble, her whine, her click when I kick her into higher gear. Her rumble, her whine, click. Rumble,  whine, click. 
  I'm going fast enough now. Scanning the road, checking the mirrors, looking for brake lights and blinkers, am I in a safe position? Am I in a blind spot? Is anyone merging in? Push left go left. Push right go right.  I could go faster,  she has another whine and click to give me, but this is fine. The wind dancing with my jacket, and pants legs. The bugs splattering into my visor, smiling at my decision to buy a full face. 
  A serenity sets in, I thought I would be more scared of this. This is about as calm as I can ever remember being. Most certainly as calm as I have ever been while sober. Those invasive thoughts and horrible memories are far behind me.  My mind is focused on what's in front.
   I used to have trouble finding a reason to get out of bed, now I wake up looking for excuses to ride. I used to hate going to sleep just to avoid laying in bed where the horrible memories attack me the most, now I look forward to going to bed so I can wake up and ride again. 
  I love it. I love my bike. I love myself when I'm on my bike. I love stopping, I love taking off, I love changing lanes. I love the low speed maneuvers I learned in BRC so I can pull up like a boss. I love the wave from other bikers. I love running errands, going for hot dogs or ice creams, kids waving. I love seeing dogs stick their heads out of windows. I love that a tank of gas is less money than a fast food combo. 100 miles is less than $10 away.

"I‚Äôve been going through a break up from a relationship of 3 years. I‚Äôm 17 so she was my first actual love. We started dating freshman year and we are both seniors now. The break up happened about 4 weeks ago and it hasn‚Äôt gotten any easier, so I thought I‚Äôd go out for a ride to clear my head. Was ripping down some back roads and I came to a stop sign and heard a little girl scream. I look over and in the left side of the intersection a little girl in the back seat of her parents car was staring at me and my bike smiling and waving. I waved back and to my surprise they where heading my direction. So, I let them go in front and the whole time she was waving and watching me through the rear window. So I slowed down and did a little pull and got my wheel off the ground. She was literally jumping in her seat with excitement. Then when I slowed down I had some backfire and the smile on her face was so bright. When we got to the next Intersection they turned and she looked back and waved goodbye. I could see her dad mouth the words ‚Äúthank you‚Äù in the side view mirror. That tiny moment made me cry. I mean stuff like that is part of the reason why I ride. I remember being that age doing the exact same thing. I would wait and watch the motorcycles ride past my street at night when I was younger. I would wave to every rider at a light or stop sign. And that‚Äôs where my fascination began. But that tiny moment made me just feel like I‚Äôm doing something more, because this break up has made me feel so useless and miserable.

After a quick inspection, my mechanically inexperienced self decided the bike is in decent enough condition to finish the two minute ride back home.

The next morning I think to check the oil level. I start the bike, it's at 80F, lean it over so it's straight.... don't see any oil. Lean it over a lot more.... all I see is a single drop of oil stuck onto the sight glass. I immediately shut off the bike.

I don't recall seeing any oil dripping under the bike, and there's none on the back tire. Does the engine eat the oil? I'm confused as to how this happened.

Should I put new oil in it and see if it leaks?

"Hi. I've been riding for quite a few years now, but for financial reasons have never progressed past a 125 on repeated CBTs. I ride a CBF125 - as reliable as they come and does the job just right, but the model's well known for needing their tyres topped up regularly.

So to save trips to the garage I've bought a manual pump - one of these [https://smile.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000V5DJPW/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_asin\_title\_o02\_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000V5DJPW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)

But the connector, unlike the ones at the garage, has a thread on it. And it's awkward to undo, meaning that after getting them to the right psi, I hear a lot of air hissing out as I'm unscrewing it. Am I doing something wrong, or need a different connector or something?

Also, at this time of year I'm reminded how light the bike is as the wind tries to shift me into the path of oncoming lorries. I've never worked out how to ride in windy conditions and find it slightly terrifying tbh - any tips?

I was excited and enjoying the new tires.  I‚Äôve never got the expensive kind before.  They‚Äôre fine for short rides but I noticed if I get them warmed up the center is very, very greasy.  Like I can easily do wheelies very controlled with ice cold tires but after half an hour riding and doing a handful of wheelies the rear tire starts spinning out constantly.  I almost have to stop riding after an hour or two at most, because I can barely give it full throttle in any gear and it starts spinning out and then wheelies become nearly impossible. 

Has anyone else experienced this ? I tried lowering my psi and it became MUCH, MUCH worse, to the point I was spinning the tire in 6th gear even‚Ä¶I adjusted the psi up from 30 to 32, 34 etc‚Ä¶back to the 40 it was at before.  It‚Äôs not as terrible as it was with lower psi but still.  It‚Äôs pretty ridiculous that I can‚Äôt go riding for more than about one tank of gas before needing to stop for hour(s) to get the rear to stop being so damn greasy. 

They‚Äôre great tires if you‚Äôre riding casual.  But if you‚Äôre doing wheelies or riding hard on a 100+HP bike I would stay away from them.  Sad thing is my bike is pathetically weak, like 55lbs of torque at peak.  Lots of naked and liter bikes have twice or triple that torque.  I‚Äôve seen people using road 5s on those bigger bikes too though so idk.

" Hey all, I'm getting close to my wits end here - need some advice before I cave and spend $500-$900 at a mechanic.

I  had some issues starting up my '06 Honda Shadow Aero 750 - would start  up but would stall once I put her in first gear and noticed I had some  gas leaking from the carb. So I accepted the task and took out the carb,  cleaned everything, and put it all back together just as I found it  (took LOTS of pictures).

Now the engine doesn't start at all. Here is some important info

\- Put in brand new spark plugs and was working fine a month prior  
\- Changed the Oil and filter last month  
\- Carb was gummed up and gas overflowed (filled up) the air filter - emptied, cleaned and replaced air filter  
\-  Went back the next day to try starting her up again (choke out, fuel  on, etc.) to see if the carb needed time to fill with gas. Still nothing

Just went back and checked all the hoses to ensure nothing is pinched and saw  a my fuel cock hose is cracked (leaking) getting a new one now  - any  other advice???",Need Advice - Novice: Just cleaned my carb and now my engine won't start...,1.0,motorcycle,Barkanator,True

Hey guys, I have a university project where students have to come up with a potential product or service as a way to introduce them to entrepreneurship and starting their own companies with innovative ideas. One portion of this assignment is performing a market analysis to determine how our product would be received by the public, how we would need to modify our idea to better shape consumer needs, and of course how much money the company could potentially make.

My first question for this community is how you feel about your helmets. Literally anything you can think of. What do you like about your motorcycle helmet? Is there anything at all that you dislike about your helmet? Do you only have one, or do you have multiple? How would you improve your helmet's design? If you do not wear a helmet regularly, why not? How much did you pay for your current helmet, and do you think that was a good deal or not? Do you prefer open-face helmets or ones with visors? Is there anything else you would like to say about your helmet?

I ask all these helmet-related questions because our group's innovative idea is a helmet with a heads-up display. It could have audio and visual aspects such as routes, traffic information, speed, fuel levels and fuel economy, etc. much like a car's dashboard but in a more compact form to make it usable by motorcyclists. With this information in mind, how much more money would you spend on a ""high-tech helmet"" over a standard helmet?

If you have any questions, I'll try my best to answer them as well. Thank you for reading this and I hope you can provide me with some excellent information to help me and my group complete this project! :)",Questions for University Project,1.0,motorcycle,OGAtlasHugged,True

So I did a little write up real quick on [how to polish out the lenses](http://imgur.com/a/7QOlInq)

Disclaimer - not all lenses can be polished. Do not do this to your LCD screens and such. For obvious reasons of you're gonna destroy them.

Also it's not 100% safe. Some lenses, mainly newer stuff. Has a special coating on the outsides much like headlight lenses. Once you sand this off it'll oxidize fast and suffer UV damage. If you're unsure.. You can sand to 2000 grit. Spray with 2k clear after, let it cure, then sand off any orange peel and compound/polish. This will 100% protect your lenses.

If you have brand new stuff. Go call a few local cellphone shops. Ask them about custom screen protectors. It's a little machine that looks like a vinyl plotter and they can actually cut a protector to match your new screen and it will be more durable then the straight plastic and look good too.

"Hi everyone, 

Yesterday I posted about my motorcycle radiator smoking after I finished a ride. It was in the rain, so I thought that it might just be steam. Since then, I kept the it in the garage and waited for it to dry off and see if it would happen again. I tried it today (dry, in the garage) and it happened again, and the smoke was coming from the same side. I noticed that just like yesterday, the very right side of the radiator was still noticeably wet while the rest was dry (link to picture below). This was the exact area the smoke was coming from when the bike was at temperature.  Is it possible for a leak to be in this exact area? I don't really smell the ""sweet"" smell of coolant; perhaps my sense of smell is bad.

"Hello, beginner rider here.

In my country here in the Phillippines, we've usually stuck to scooters and underbones, small tight streets and beautiful mountain passes.

I've been riding a Honda 125cc for almost 2 years, and for the riding experience? You'd always be finding yourself asking for more.

I was passed/given a CB400SF, and already ridden it in 3 weeks, usually on light traffic roads and empty ones.

Tbh I'm not a fast rider, but I'm not afraid of going fast, although I rarely do it, since my lil honda can't even do 90kmh.

Took out my CB400 out for a ride on an empty main road (quarantine, streets are usually empty.) 
I usually ride moderately, always changing gears on 6k, getting a feel on the 54hp that the I4 delivers, I always noticed it just runs out breath on higher revs, thought the carbs were fucked, but no, I realized that Ive been riding it like if it was my 125cc honda.

For once, I dropped a gear, and holy shit this thing was actually fast, I just did a 40kmh to 130kmh in like a blip, never felt a surge of power before, since I4s really pull on high revs and I wasn't on that powerband on my earlier rides.

For some, yes 130kmh seems slow, but in our country? and roads this small? Its pretty fast, and scary.

Guess thats the magic of riding a motorcycle, you think its just going from A to B, but I guess thats not always the case.

Just wanted to share my experience, and ride safely folks.","First time fast riding my CB400SF, holy shit it pulls and its actually fucking fast.",1.0,motorcycle,Handsomelad42,True

"Hello all.

Been lurking a while just reading, but figured it was time to jump in and get involved.

So I'm in the UK and I started riding last year.

Took the CBT at a dreadful place semi nearby (which has since closed down). It wasn't a good experience, the guy taking it wasn't at all interested so I didn't really learn anything. Luckily for me my partner has been riding bikes for more than 3 decades and so was able to plug gaps.

Took and passed my theory first time in April this year when test centres reopened, then booked and waited a long time for a DAS course at the best place locally. 

Took the DAS in late Sept. Unfortunately the chap I was on the course with wasn't really ready and the result was my 4 days training was more like 2 days training and I didn't get all I needed from it. Poor guy dropped his bike twice on the road on day 2, day 3 was spent not on the road trying to get his confidence back. He did not come back for day 4.

The result was that I got lots of practice for and passed MOD1 with a clean sheet but just missed out on passing MOD2 due to nerves and feeling of not being ready/having the appropriate local test route knowledge. 

Have since then had 3 separate trainers from two separate places tell me I'm ready to test - but when test day comes I get so nervous I make lots of silly mistakes. I've never had a dangerous but always end up with a major for generally fairly minor things.

Just wondering if anyone has any experience in similar and what they did to overcome it, or have any good advice for combating nerves?

For context I don't drive a car as I am mildly dyspraxic which makes nerves just that little bit less manageable.

The sidestand is NOT meant to support that much weight. It's almost never an issue, but spin at your own risk. I've seen bent and broken sidestands. It's rare, but it happens. 

But the much bigger and more likely issue:

KEEP YOUR FOOT ON THE SIDESTAND, AND ALWAYS KEEP THE FORCE BACKWARDS. If you don't do this, you are at serious risk of the sidestand folding over mid-turn. If it does fold, not even the Hulk will be able to hold up the weight of the bike from going to the ground.

"So my 96 Virago 750 is starting to die at stoplights more frequently than it used to when I picked it up a couple weeks ago. It runs great, has no issue starting at half choke. I normally let it run for a minute or two, kick the choke off and run. 

Here are the facts:

The bike occaisonally backfires through the airbox if I blip it too quick when downshifting, but not everytime. It is intermittent. This leads me to believe that I have a slight leak on one or both of my intake manifold boots. I have not yet sprayed some carb cleaner on the boot with the engine running to be sure, but I am fairly confident this is the problem. I think I've started subconsciously blipping it slower to prevent that because it used to happen more frequently when I picked it up. 

It had been sitting for years with empty and drained carbs so they weren't gummed up at all. No gunk in the bowl etc. Tank was lined by the previous owner.

The electrical system is known to be charging fine.

Spark plugs are unknown but Im assuming they are okay and its just the boots.


I am considering just giving it a LITTLE bit more fuel to counteract this. I should probably take it in to get the boots changed but I'm a little tight this month. Would adding just a little bit more fuel help my issue in the short term?

"I noticed almost everyone who ride seems to have always wanted to, is there anyone who didn't at first and it grew on them later?


Did you always want to ride and took a MSF course?


Did you ask your parents/siblings/friend to teach you in the driveway?


Did you not like motorcycles before and was peer pressured into trying one and discovered it is actually really fun?


Did you get on it with safety first in mind or did you just decide to wing it and see what happens?


So my pilot story:


I grew up with 2 older brothers in a more rural-ish town in AZ and was always picked on (in a loving way) with things that was ""for boys"". When I was about 14-15ish, they both got dirt bikes and would spend weekends out in the desert. I never had any real interest in motorcycles of any kind up till then, I thought they were noisy and dirty and dangerous, they would often come home with road rash and scrapes all the time. Then one summer they planned a road trip to Mammoth in California with a family friend, I've never been and I said something like I wanted to go. They were planning on taking the dirt bikes with them to ride there, the family friend had an extra bike and offered to let me borrow it if I went with them. He was more or less joking since he knew I've never ridden one, but one of my brothers said something along the lines of, she won't go, she's too scared to ride one. I apparently had a point to prove because 2 weeks later I was staring at a green (kawasaki?) 450 on a trailer in Mammoth. I forgot the exact model. It was tall, I had a hard time reaching the ground, I had a helmet that didn't fit my head and absolutely no gear. Think I was wearing jeans and a tank top and tennis shoes. I remember watching youtube videos on how to operate a bike so I could pretend I knew what I was doing, which didn't help because I stalled it multiple times in the parking lot and never got past 2nd gear. I remember that first ride very well since it was a bit traumatizing. Stalling it over and over on steep uphills (not that steep it was an easy trail). They were hanging back at first then after an hour they went ahead and left me in the back, I've ridden mountain bicycles before so I wasn't entirely hopeless, but I've never descended a trail on such a large and heavy bike, I grabbed a handful of front brake in a turn and lowside, managed to wrestle the bike up by myself then did it again a few minutes later. Showed up at the bottom to find they've been waiting for 30 minutes having a beer. I was on the verge of tears from anxiety but seeing them at the bottom having a laugh on my expense just made me mad. However it was after that I realized that despite all that, I liked it more than I thought I would. It was freeing, adventurous, a rush. I rode dirt bikes for a few more years before I moved out to California for school and switched to street, now some 15 years later I ride an R1 almost as a daily driver.",What was your first experience riding a motorcycle and why did you get on it?,1.0,motorcycle,BluPengwin,True

"First and foremost please delete if this is not ok.

I have found that ""bikers"" are brutally honest and since i have no fucking idea where else to post this since I don't really use reddit except for this and the ""Motorcycles"" I'm posting it here.

I have been told i have a lot of rules that i live by, so i thought I'd write them down.  I probably haven't written them all down, but this is what i have so far.

Just curious if anyone else thinks this way or if I'm just fucking bonkers.

Plus a lot of this stuff ive taken up since i started riding a motorcycle.

My rules that i live by (too be added to)

  

1. Always show respect, but never fear.

2. Speaking of respect: ‚ÄúSmile‚Äù when you meet someone; it hides your true motive.

3. Open the door for whomever is behind you. This will A: allow you to see who‚Äôs behind you and B: if they *are* following you, they‚Äôll know that you know who they are. And if they just happen to be behind you, it goes back to Rule #1.

4. Have a knife on you, from the moment you leave the house, till the moment you come home. If home is a temporary shelter ie. a hotel or even a friend‚Äôs house, never let your knife out of your sight, better yet keep it on you as if you weren‚Äôt at your current place to sleep.

5. Keep your eyes towards the door, never your back.

6. When driving, be aware of your surroundings, at all times. If you pull onto an unfamiliar street, stop, get your bearings straight. In this day and age, you can use your phone to triangulate your position, so there‚Äôs no excuse.

7. Keep at least $50 on you, in small bills.

8. Have $100 stashed in your vehicle, in small bills, that you never touch.

9. You‚Äôll always need at least four gift cards for various fast-food locations that are easy to get to, open either very late or, preferably, 24 hours, in the amount of $15-$25. It‚Äôs enough to feed you in case of an emergency and get you outta the weather (and not be bothered because you‚Äôre eating - just eat slow if need be) but not enough to really hurt financially if you lose one of them.

10. Always have a cell phone charger, and cord for your phone with you. Whether you are at the mall, going to buy groceries, hell even if you are just getting gas

11. Which brings me to have a backpack filled with random stuff that you would need if you ran out of gas, got kicked out of your current ride ie. your Uber or Lyft driver leaves you stranded, your bus dies and you need to walk home, the Amtrack train hits something and you need to wait for another ride, etc. etc.

12. When in your vehicle, have an extra pair of boots with you (and socks).

13. And hat, preferred a wide-brim hat, but for storage purposes a baseball hat works well too.

14. Be aware of where the exits and doors and cameras are in any place you enter.

15. When walking to your vehicle, keep your keys in your hand, your phone in your pocket (locked) and your knife (see rule #4) accessible. This also harks back to rule #6.

16. When you get home, take a shower because you don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôll be able to take one the next day (natural disaster, you get locked up, there‚Äôs an emergency and you‚Äôre not home for three days).",I have no idea where to post this....,1.0,motorcycle,TattooedHooligan,True

"Hi! 

New to this sub but not to riding. in past months been riding diff bikes (Monster 696 '08 and currentley a Bandit 650 '07)

I want to point out that I am am more of a Naked bike type of person. As you can see from my last two motos, I love twisties and a naked with some torque.  
The 696 nver had issues there , as it pumps quickly out of corners and keeps easily with bigger bikes. The bandit is a 216kg thiccy girl though with a good exhaust and some 9ish hp, I find my self needing to down shift before corners and sometimes before overtaking in straights , if I want the bike to , you know , "" move"".  
I love roudned headlights, a lot, I was suggested Honda X11. I dont think it ll be too much of a bike for me no? It looks thiccer than even my naked bandit but the engine is appearently something else. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would love to see if anyone has tried an X11 and twisted the throttle hard enough. is it gonna be that much of a dramatic change?  


I am also considering a ducati monster S4 916, but that's another thing, tried one already, felt good but the dry clutch is annoying in first gear a bit.

&amp;#x200B;

So I narrowed it down to these two , X11 and S4. What would you pick? and if u tried any of them, could u share your insight?

"Hi all, I am sorry if you get this a lot but I need some rough guidance on what sort of bike would be a sensible choice.

So I stopped riding a couple of years ago after my Lexmoto XTRS125 has some issues and winter had set in so I hung my helmet up for a bit and sold the bike, as I hated it anyway but was a cheapy bike as my Generic Worx 125 had been stolen.

Now I'm more financially stable I wanted to make the jump to a bigger bike.. I know myself too well to just settle on a 600cc, as I've always been one for things that are fast but given the time I have been off the road for, I think it may be more sensible to start with something less powerful than a 600.

So I just wanted to get some advice or recommendations from other riders who are more experienced, so any advice would be greatly appreciated!

"Hey There!

Just bought my first motorcycle, a 1977 Honda CB 550 Four K and was hoping to ask for some advice on gear. A little back story; The bike was parked for a year as the owner had a massive heart attack and cannot ride it anymore. He did put in a new battery yesterday to see if it would run, and it didn't. Not too worried about that as I heard it crank from the electric start and the motor turned over, most likely a carb clean and some new gas will do the trick. My dad and myself are mechanically inclined so i'm not worried about it. The bike is in beautiful condition, no peeling clear coat, no rust on the fenders, no cracks in the seat. I was shocked. Its almost 100% original minus the back tire and I believe the exhaust has been replaced as its a 4 to 2 exhaust. Also I am the 3rd owner. 

My general questions are.

What type of full faced helmet that is modern would you wear with this? 

What type of general maintenance do you do to your vintage bikes?

What other general advice would you give to a first time rider?

Ive watched hours of videos on different things but curious what other riders have to say! 

Thanks everyone!

the reason it‚Äôs not plugged in yet is because the fcr41 has a different tps mount and the tps on the fcr is a much higher ohm range than the stock tps, also i kinda broke the stock tps so i need to order a new one and try to get it mounted onto the fcr carb 

another thought i was having was that a tps is just a potentiometer used as a voltage divider, so it shouldn‚Äôt matter too much that the ohms are different on the fcr‚Äôs tps because the voltage fed into it will still be 12v and ground so the output voltage should be the same no matter what tps is used. that might be a dumb idea but im not as well versed with electrical engineering as some so any help is appreciated 

do i really need the tps to advance timing or is rpm ignition advance good enough, can i splice in a higher ohm range tps and will it work the same since the ignition controller is only reading a voltage not a resistance, and does anyone have a spare tps for a cb919, cb900f, hornet 900, or vtr1000f (they all used the same tps, and some old honda civics used it too)",how does disconnecting the tps on a carb‚Äôd bike affect ignition timing,1.0,motorcycle,nosliw_rm,True

"Hello everybody, so happy I got my motorcycle license. Just trying to encourage others who are kind of scared to go on one to feel more motivated. I did it at Harley Davidson. 

A few tips:

If you feel like you won't pass the test, don't worry, it's not that hard and the testing is lenient. My bike fell over like 4 times during training and turned off like almost 15-20 times. Completely messed up the sharp right turn from a stop and the u-turn. Still passed(but did good on everything else),

A few tips for riding:

\-Look where you want to turn.

\-When you do very tight slow turns, open the clutch a little bit so you can build some speed. Going too slow will cause you to fall (learned that from u-turns)

\-Don't open up the clutch too fast, bike will turn off. Happened way too many times. 

\-Lean a little bit when turning but sometimes will have to stay up straight and push the handle bar of the direction you're going. 

\-Almost all of your riding will be in the friction zone for the clutch.

\-If you can take tight turns you'll be good.

\-Have fun!

What the test was:

1. Sharp right turn and u turn (probably hardest)
2. Swerve around some cones and take normal left turn (easy)
3. speed up and swerve around object in middle of road (takes some time but also easy)
4. quick stop (pulling throttle and then just fully braking, very easy)
5. ride a curve (just normally riding, easy)

"Hello, this is my first post here, so nice to (virtually) meet you all!

First off I am a 25 year old male. 5ft 11"" 170 pounds.  Ive had my license (car) for almost 10 years.  Im kind of a car guy so I've had many cars in the past and never owned an auto.

I started riding dirt bikes when I was about 10-11 years old. Had a little 80cc honda. Then progressed from there to a 100cc, then to a 140cc kawasaki. When I was about 15 I got into motocross and bought a cr125 and then an rm125 at 16 and kept that bike for while. Rode it on the trails too which was actually pretty fun after getting used to the throttle and power band in the woods. I have also ridden 450cc mx bikes although at that time I preferred the lighter 2 stroke bikes. Ended up selling that bike when I was about 19-20 to help buy a car. 

Ive always wanted a street bike but have been hesitant to get one because of the different set of dangers that come with operating a bike on the street. I know that riding on the street is a different ball game than dirt. As I have gotten older and I have started seriously looking I have lost interest in the SS bikes and I have fallen in love with the naked style bikes. Right now im looking at the mt07 and mt09. After researching both bikes extensively, I fell mainly toward the 09. The sound, the looks, the ergos, everything checked the boxes for me. But im sure if you've looked at just about any youtube video or website everyone says its pretty much going to kill me and it is not beginner friendly. I haven't had a ticket in over 8 years (knock on wood) while daily driving cars that could definitely get me in trouble. Never been in a single accident (again knock on wood.) I feel like I am a pretty responsible guy and I feel like I could handle the 09 but at the same time I want to be safe, I don't want to step over my head. I feel the 07 is not really what I am looking for but also may be the better bike to start with in the long run. Either way I would respect both machines as I am aware of what they are capable of.  I would prefer to buy once rather than twice as I want to eventually end up with the 09, but will get the 07 first if guys think that may be the better choice given my lack of street experience.

I offered $6,250 for it, and respectfully declined the deal for now because 7 is more than I'd like to spend.

" 

So I recently got into bikes. Got a used BMW g650gs. And its awesome, but as with pretty much anything in life, I always grow out of my initial wants. Its almost too nice. And its also not off road friendly. I'd get the Sertao (which was what I actually really wanted in the first place but couldn't find), but I honestly don't even want anymore BMWs. They're too expensive even used. And to fix. There's other peculiarities about em I don't like. So I was spitballin what bike I would wanna save up for next, as I def wanna keep my GS.

Anyway, so a reasonably cheap side or used one is what I'm out for, cause I don't make much money. Not a piece of shit, or too used obvi. Just a durable, cool, yet unassuming, humbly priced bike. My first choice was a RE Himalayan. And before anyone naysays, I'm def aware they're basically fat and slow. However, I rationalize it by being more of a back road rider anyway, and the fact it seems like a descent off road bike, which is something I wanna start doing (exploring, not like tricks on tracks or anything).

And this is all under the guise of the fact that the latest model is like 5,000. I'm sure I could get something really better for a few thou more, but trust me when I say I'd be happier to sacrifice the extra stuff for the extra money. I think the Him is overall a good deal and seems like it'd just be a cool bike to have and ride. Sides I could save up 5 in a decent amount of time. Lastly, I'm completely obsessed with the look of it, aaand there's a dealer for em right by me.

My other hypothetical choices were a dr650, or a klr650. Like older, used models (absolutely hate the modern klr650 looks wise). And my very last idea. Speaking of older models, I don't want electric start. I kinda wanted a kickstart because they're just old school reliable. So I was thinkin, if I could find one, I'd for sure say fuck all the other ideas and get a MT500 easy. I read somewhere it could survive an EMP? It also tops out at 95, so faster than the Himalayan, and I also think it weighs less.

And so to wrap it up, I'm basically looking for a reliable, descent priced, new or used bike I can take off road (within reason), and not worry at all about beating up a bit. Not that I wanna beat them up, I just don't want anything fancy, or too nice, or too expensive. Also something at least the same weight or lighter than mine, which is around 415 lbs I think. I feel like the MT500 fits this criteria perfectly and I could travel the continent amid a zombie apocalypse on the sucker. Granted I'm ever able to find one, and granted it would even be in my price range, cause they seem rare. Anyway any advice for a bike noob?

Might also be worth mentioning and save anyone the trouble of making certain recommendations: I'm really only into dirt bikes/dual sport/adventure/touring styles. Something in those categories, that's lightweight-ish, and you wouldn't be afraid to beat up a little. Also maybe two cylinder? Mines a single, and I'd be interested to know the feel and gearing and alleged smoothness of a twin cyl (mine vibrates a lot). And like mostly lookin for plastic bodied. With some exceptions in mind, like the Himalayan has the metal (steel?) tank and there's not much plastic really. Just like no cruisers and such. Anyway, I'm sure you guys get the picture (whoever decided to read this bullshit lol). And sorry if I explain shit bad, I'm pretty new to motorcycles.

P.S. If I had the money though, I'd get a Harley Pan Am for sure. Or the MT, and spend the rest on supplies to trek the country.",Advice On Next Motorcycle Ideas?,1.0,motorcycle,Nic_Kname,True

"Hey y'all,

Does anyone know what the process is for getting my license after the MSF course in NC? Here, they only do the motorcycle skills test on certain days of the week.

"This may he obvious to some of you who already haul your bike for some offroading or track days, but as a daily commuter, it's an option for getting your bike home if you own a truck. Also get some good tie down straps now, to make sure your bike stays safe during transport. 

Had my clutch cable brake this week, and while in the future I'll make sure to change it out sooner (and order a spare to keep with the bike), it's nice having the option to be able to take the bike home while avoiding the tow and uber fare home ($$$).
 
I usually wrench on my bike, so it pains me to pay $100+ on labor, plus the uber home ($100), to fix a part that costs $35. (I'm also a cheapskate, but that has nothing to do with not keeping up with maintenance--i just didn't realize I should change my clutch cable before 50k miles.)

Since I already made this post, I'd like read what some of you commuters have or have as backups for when things go awry, and I'll start:

My on bike kit include: tire inflator, plugs, zip ties, super glue, tire pressure gauge, pliers, ruler (for chain slack), shopping bag, flashlight, chain master link, chain press kit.

"Ok so quick bio on myself. Been riding since January 2019 and still on L plates. Partly through choice and partly through circumstance.
Took my test in my first year riding and failed so decided to get bit more road experience under my belt before trying again.
The 2020 hit, first lockdown lost me my job and drained my savings dry paying bills so no money for test and big bike.
Joined a great bike group full of crazy brilliant people and they have become like family to me and I care about all of them.
In my 3 years I've had a handful of accidents which I can honestly say weren't down to me and while a couple of them looked serious I always managed to pick myself up and get back on the bike and it never affected me that much.

But today, today was different.
Went out on a small group adventure ride out and while there were some hiccups along the way we were all enjoying ourselves and it was going good. 
Right up until the accident.
Narrow country lane with loads of potholes and fine gravel.
I watched as the rider in front of me tried to brake and swerve round a rather large pothole only for their front wheel to slide and bike tip onto them.
I couldn't avoid right otherwise I'd hit their bike which they were entangled with and cause more harm. 
Tried to avoid left while applying the brakes but loose gravel wise like ice and front wheel dug into the pothole they tried to avoid and I couldn't turn at all and my front wheel caught the other rider in the upper back as the were laying on the floor.

Ambulance called and they were exceedingly lucky with just deep tissue bruising but the scene keeps replaying over and over in my head.
Everyone there, from group riders to police, ambulance and road safety officer agreed it was unavoidable and I couldn't have missed her had I done anything different but what keeps playing in my mind is them laying on the floor crying in pain yet still caring more about whether I was ok and that breaks my heart.
I can't sleep with it replaying in my head over and over.

"Hi, 

&amp;#x200B;

BMW R nine T pure 2020, 7k miles, always serviced by the stealership. 

&amp;#x200B;

I unwillingly had to leave my motorcycle parked for 6 weeks as I was out of the country. On return I jumped on for my first ride and while it didn't fire up the first try, the second was a GO. I took the bike to wash because it got nasty althought it was nicely wrapped up. On arriving to the car wash I switched off and it wouldnt switch back on. 

&amp;#x200B;

I realized that this is a power issue, I left for 15 minutes and turned it on, ON again, thankfully could ride it back home but on return the battery was completely dead. Took the seat off and checked with a multimeter, 11.24V. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is how do I know if I can simply recharge and bury my head in the sand or I actually need to spend hours replacing my battery for the first time. 

&amp;#x200B;

p.s. I know I should have used a battery tender, I ordered one last night (Optimate CAN) and will try connecting and seeing it's self check battery health monitor.

I was thinking about Enduro bikes, I don't plan to do motocross, track just want to get to work and back and in the summer I like to ride around lakes on weekends.

So no off-road,it's mostly city so tarmac, maybe sometimes little bit of gravel, but nothing extreme. I don't do wheelies or stuff.

Maybe tenere or super tenere? Or Africa twin? I read they're reliable.

I guess what's super important to me is good traction on wet roads.

"Posting this here for anyone else considering buying from Abel Brown...

TLDR: No phone number to reach them, chat box is just an automated ""check your order details"" bot, didn't respond to the 4 emails I sent them over the course of 5 days, shipped my item 4 days after I requested they cancel it and 11 days after I'd ordered it, you can only return items for store credit... I don't know how you could be worse as a business.

Ordered a pair of gloves as a present on Friday September 10th. The website didn't show them as being out of stock, and per their own guidance, if an item is found to be out of stock after ordering they will promptly send you a notification email. Delivery turnaround for items which are in stock, is supposed to be same day if ordered before 2pm. So one would assume the item to be shipped by next day or to receive an email indicating the item is on backorder. Now I ordered on a Friday, so I'll give the benefit of the doubt and assume it ships on Monday 9/13.

By Thursday 9/16 I still haven't received a confirmation that the item has shipped, so I head over to the website to see if there's a number I can call. There is not. Huge red flag. I send a message on the Abel Brown chat box and only receive an automated response to check my order details. There is the ubiquitous info@abelbrown.com, so I reach out that way, asking about the shipping status of the item. In lieu of a response to my email, I receive an automated shipping update providing a tracking number. Now I know the item has not magically been shipped within the short amount of time since I've written the email, but maybe it was sent earlier and I just hadn't gotten the notification? I check the tracking info, and sure enough it's pending delivery to the shipper for transport. No ETA for when Abel Brown will actually be dropping it off to be shipped. You can create a label anytime you want, doesn't mean it's being shipped anytime soon.

I check the tracking info again the next day (Friday 10/17) and sure enough, it still hasn't been delivered to the shipper. At this point I realize it will not make it in time for the birthday I purchased it for, so I email Abel Brown again requesting that my order be cancelled. Once again this is on a Friday, and I'm willing to believe they don't get around to it that day, and maybe they don't work on the weekends, so when Monday (9/20) rolls around and I still haven't received any response, I email them again asking for confirmation of my cancelled order. I then double check the tracking info they'd provided 4 days earlier, and it's still not actually shipped. 

Well today (Tuesday 9/21) I checked the tracking number yet again, and it's FINALLY shipped. The day after the birthday I had purchased it for. I've already had to go buy another gift. I am now realizing the return policy is for store credit and since these idiots realized they had me by the short and curlies and could just ignore me until the package actually shipped, they now have my money no matter what.

"TL;DR: We want to convince our evaluators to let us do an on helmet display. What are your opinions on having a display on the helmet/visor vs on the dashboard of the motorcycle?
 
Hi everyone,

With mod approvable (thank you!), I wanted to make this post to gather some opinions about our senior design project. My group (Electrical and Computer Engineers) is doing a yearlong design project where we will be making a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù safety helmet. The purpose of this helmet is making motorcycles safer. Currently we are still on the drafting phase and are butting heads with our evaluators on some components. It would be wonderful to receive some of your opinions.

Our Proposal:

In April 2022, our team will demonstrate a helmet that exemplifies safety features not commonly implemented in motorcycle safety. Motorcycle accidents are commonly caused by other drivers on the road, primarily in cars and buses. Out of the 276 million vehicles in the US, 8.1 million are motorcycles which is roughly 2.89% of the population. However, out of about 35000 road deaths each year, around 5000 deaths are related to motorcycle accidents, this is an alarmingly higher percentage of 14.28%. Our team aims to change this by increasing the scope of safety features in motorcycle helmets. We will present a series of scenarios to demonstrate the use of the safety features we believe should become normalized for motorcycles, with features that can already be found in many cars.

One of the most efficient ways of ensuring the protection of bikers would be to technologically update their helmets with much needed safety features. The main priority of the helmet should be to assist the rider in avoiding any potential hazards on the road. This would be achieved with sensors that are located around the helmet, more specifically located at the bikers blindspots. These sensors would be able to detect and inform the rider about approaching vehicles, which they could analyze and respond appropriately in order to avoid a potential accident. The information that is passed from the sensors to the rider would be displayed onto the visor which is composed of a transparent OLED display. The main priority of this display is to minimize distractions for the biker, while providing enough data to ensure their safety. The display would interact with the rider via a symbol or light (similar to Blind Spot Warning found in many modern cars) rather than text, as a result the OLED display could be replaced by LEDs instead. In the event that the motorcyclist gets into an accident, the helmet would utilize the mounted accelerometer and gyroscope to detect falls/crashes and would contact emergency personnel. The helmet would report the GPS location of the biker, medical id, and emergency contact information.
Similar existing technologies include the CrossHelmet X1 and Livemap Digital Helmets, which are two motorcycle helmets with augmented HUDs. Although these two helmets are similar in the fact that they are both digital helmets, they are both purposed for very different uses than our solution. Apart from being very expensive (both &gt;$1600), these are do-it-all solutions that pack features such as navigation, playing music and answering calls. They have very few safety features (only the CrossHelmet X1 has a rear-view camera) and these additional features could often distract the driver and possibly lead to road safety issues.  
Other solutions to the safety problems in motorcycles include in-vehicle system of sensors like the Bosch Advanced Rider Assistance system. These systems involve the addition of LiDAR and infrared sensors to the motorcycle itself during manufacturing. However, these systems are seen in high-end expensive motorcycles, with the Bosch system being deployed in &lt;10 motorcycles since its launch in 2019. The average motorcyclist does not have access to these features, which in our opinion can be crucial in saving lives. Therefore, our digital safety helmet solution will be a unique system with its focus on driver safety and ubiquity of potential use.


Here is where you guys come in. 

Our group is committed to having a display on the helmet/visor. However, our evaluators are completely against this idea and would instead like it to be on the dashboard of the motorcycle instead. Our main argument for keeping it on the helmet is that 1. It would look cooler since an integrated helmet Hud is new and keeping it onto the dashboard is the same as having a phone on there. 2. For us (and we are not experienced at all so do feel free to correct us), having the display onto the dashboard would be dangerous primarily because of the time it takes for riders to look down. This action creates a new blind spot in front as the rider is not focused on the road. The display, on the other hand, would allow the rider to keep their focus on the road (since the time it takes to adjust your eye from far to close is far less than the time it takes to move your head down). 
What are your opinions. Would you rather have a heads-up display on the helmet or on the bike? And for those who own a helmet with a heads-up display on the helmet, what is it like? Is focusing on the display difficult since it is so close to the eye or is it not a problem at all?

The second place we would like to receive feedback is the blind spot detection. Currently our idea is to have a rear facing camera on the helmet that would be large enough to cover the blind spots. Once it detects obstacles (vehicle switching lanes into rider‚Äôs lane through blind spots, fast approaching vehicle from behind) it would display a live feed onto the display so that the rider could make their own decision on how to avoid a potential accident. 

We would also appreciate it if we got feedback anywhere else. Any questions you may have, suggestions on how you think we should improve certain aspects of our idea, problems you have with our idea, etc.

Thinks to keep in mid:
1.	We only have a year to work on this project (Presenting the final product on April 2022). So, our overall project cannot be too ambitious that it would take us longer than that to complete. It also cannot be under ambitious (if that is even a word), where we finish the project way in advance (although if we do finish a bit early and we go with a display on the helmet, it would be cool to integrate a map direction feature where it would show riders the directions on screen)
2.	Our budget is $500 max. This is for all the components in total. From sensors, cameras, battery, microcontroller (Arduino, raspberry pi, etc.), etc. One of the reasons why we wanted feedback from riders who own a smart helmet (like CrossHelmet X1) is because we are not able to afford it. Currently our plans for getting a helmet is to ask around manufacturing companies to see if they would be willing to donate helmets for our project. Yes we are that poor (it‚Äôs actually the funding all teams are getting for their projects. We are not allowed to get an injection of funds)
3.	Suggestions/additions need to be ECE focused. We can‚Äôt lean too heavy on the mechanical aspect, our project has to be more focused on Electrical (circuits stuff) and Computer (coding).

Thank you so much for your time. We appreciate your feedback so much as we don‚Äôt have much knowledge on motorcycles. Hope you have a wonderful day!",Feedback on our Senior Design Project/Capstone project,1.0,motorcycle,ThekingofDarkness21,True

"So I don‚Äôt have any video to share, I really wish I had my helmet cam with me because I‚Äôm not good with stories.
So I was riding home from work and I noticed a guy Riding a Ninja a little ways back. He was going back and forth through cars and eventually he was behind me. Naturally I sped up a little too, I was riding my Intruder. So we were both going about 85 in a 65 in front of a Tahoe that had been behind me for a while. I didn‚Äôt know it was a cop and when he hit the lights I pulled over as soon as I could because I was going a little over the limit. Well, the Ninja kept going and just kept going and the cops stayed behind him. It was so weird because he was just flowing with traffic with the cop behind him passing every good spot to pull over. He definitely was not running, or it seemed that way that way at least. He just kept driving at the limit. I watched until they were out of view and got back on the road. About a minute later I see them at a stop light and the guy is just chilling on his bike. The cop got beside him and ripped him off the bike. The cop was super pissed and being aggressive because the guy didn‚Äôt pull over I assume. It was a whole thing and the biker actually pulled himself away from the cop so he could catch his bike as he got yanked off of it. Fortunately he kept it from falling over but made thing worse for him because now he‚Äôs put in cuffs while wearing all his gear face down on the ground. So the bike was just sitting in the road with the biker now in the cop car and traffic is just flowing around it. I noticed that the fkn bike had no mirrors on it! A friend told me that it‚Äôs a thing people do with their Ninjas since they stick up a little high. A ticket for no mirrors or going a little over the limit is one thing but holy shit I hope that guy didn‚Äôt get arrested for fleeing or resisting arrest due to not knowing the cop was behind him. Also, sirens were never used just lights, hopefully he can use that for his case. I couldn‚Äôt find a police report online for arrest so hopefully it was handled without that. That‚Äôs all I got to share. It was wild  to see a fast ass bike just passively running from the cops, using his blinkers and stopping at lights.",A Slow Run From The Cops,1.0,motorcycle,MotherGoatsMalk,True

"I‚Äôm new to bikes and I‚Äôve been riding for 2 months now with my R3. I live in a remote town with not a lot of places to go to and community here is very small. When I started, I ride basically everyday right after work. Nowadays I still probably go 2 to 3 times a week. 

A few weeks back I was lucky enough to ride with my friend from work and her husband on a long trip and back. It was a great feeling having someone to ride with so I decided to look for a group on facebook. There‚Äôs only one and it‚Äôs a sport bikes group. There‚Äôs a few hundred members there so I said why not then I joined the group.

They go for a ride every now then on weekends so I decided to invite them on a ride the other day for sunday (which is today) and I didn‚Äôt get any response. The day after 2 people asked what time and what day and then they said they‚Äôre coming too. 

On the sunday morning I came 15 minutes early and had breakfast. When it was time, nobody showed up. Then I saw a guy on his gsxr fully geared up. He looked at me but then continue riding off. Not sure if he was the one on the group. Anyways, I stayed for another 20 minutes and nada.

One of the members DMed me and asked if I was the one with the r1, I said no I only ride an r3. He didn‚Äôt reply back. 

I also noticed that these guys only ride liter bikes. Not sure if that‚Äôs got to do with anything because it‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre gonna go racing. All I know is I feel like I don‚Äôt belong in their circles.

I dunno, maybe I‚Äôm just overthinking it.

I decided to ride alone to my destination which was my first long ride and I had a great time. I‚Äôve realised that I didn‚Äôt need anyone to have a good ride. Just me and bike is enough. 

It‚Äôs a shame though, because like I said it‚Äôs a small town and there‚Äôs little to no community around riders here unless you‚Äôre an elite. You‚Äôd have more chances with the harley guys but unfortunately harley is not my style.

Someone posted a video here in reddit just awhile ago (not sure which sub) about a meetup in the ozarks. That looked like a lot of fun and i wish I‚Äôm in that too.

When coming to a stop, should I downshift and throttle a little every down gear, or can I just hold the clutch and downshift to first from third-fourth, one after another without letting go the clutch?

When, if ever, do I mess with the fuel line or choke? I barely understand what they do and all the info about it is hard to find, or in Japanese, which I can barely read. The fuel line has three settings, but I just leave it open all the time. Bad idea?

Flat roads and turns I understand, but what about everything else, basically, is what I'm asking. Trying to not damage the bike.

"Had a great convo with a co-worker (uber avid rider) about non human encounters during 2 wheel journeys. 

This stemmed from a story about my commute home yesterday when a hawk dove bombed into my leg. I was cruising at about 90 MPH (with one hand on the bars fwiw) and noticed a hawk up ahead flying down in a sort of circle pattern. I said to myself ""does this dude see me??!? fuck!"" and pushed the bars to the left at the last second to avoid it. Instead of blasting me head on it smashed into my leg at which point I looked back in astonishment wondering if anyone witnessed the event only to see the bird ascending back into the air over the highway. Really bizarre encounter and hope the dude or dudette is ok. 

Honorable mentions:

-Hitting a possum at 100+ mph on my old airhead (your end is the road!)

-future wife riding 2up with me on the old airhead coming off a great scenic road and a bumble bee flew inside my helmet and almost immediately started burrowing itself in my ear. Almost crashed trying to stop and remove my helmet. If you  were to ask my wife she would laugh as hysterically now as she did that day.

"Shark Tail Exhaust on Single Cylinder/Exhaust Motorcycle?

Hello, I know many probably have no clue what I am talking about, firstly shark tail exhausts are as you guess exhaust tips that look like a  shark tail and are very common on Harley baggers where they extend far past the wheel base. However, I am in quite the opposite predicament, and love shark tail exhausts however I have a Suzuki (ls650) Boulevard which has a single exhaust and is just a metric cruiser. I am wondering if anyone has seen them on single exhaust motorcycles and if they look good or do you think that one would look stupid on my motorcycle.

"I'm looking to replace the cheapo switches on my handlebar with something that looks a little nicer.

----

I currently have el cheapo which looks like this: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QCJ556W/

Problems: it looks like a cheap toy and it's completely generic.  On/off *what*?  I'm also not a fan of red switches for anything non-essential.

----

I saw this one which is better because at least it specifies that it controls lights: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07483PMX3/

Problems: while specific and available in not-red, it still looks like a cheap toy.

----

I've seen a lot of switches in this vein (Motogadget makes a really nice one) that look nicer: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07483PMX3/ or  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T1JMM37/

Problems: it's generic as hell.  There's no way for a new rider to know what those buttons control.

----

I almost like these best because they use the universal vehicle symbol for lighting, and they look OEM:  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0987BWYJ8/

Problems: the two buttons' symbols seem to be for low-beams and high-beams, which doesn't really make sense for aux lights.

----

Bottom line, I'm looking for an aftermarket handlebar switch that:

1. Doesn't look cheap.
2. Is informative and specific (so a new rider would know it's for lighting).

I'll admit, I was kind of scared at first, being a total noob, but after my first 150 miles, I'm starting to feel more comfortable, though I'm still kinda slow on the curves. I'm finding that the Monster isn't too wild as long as I'm smooth on the throttle, and she handles really well.

"Last week I posted about an upcoming trip, the first one in 15 years.  It went great.  1320 miles over 3 days, no interstate, just backroads.  Something happened that I was concerned about before leaving that fortunately proved true yet again - my theory on the three days.  Whether trekking, sailing, camping, motorcycling, or anything else where you are continually in the elements, it takes three days to acclimate.  I was was worried that aging 15 years would increase fatigue, pain and soreness, and reduce my enjoyment of the long days on the bike.  I paid my dues on this trip like all others before it, but it all went like it always used to:

Day 1 - excitement, anticipation, and the onset of soreness and some fatigue as the trip begins

Day 2 - settling into the trip, becoming one with the bike and the road, and general continuous discomfort from soreness and fatigue all day long.  You sleep HARD after the second day. 

Day 3 - wake up feeling better but still a bit road weary. The ride becomes completely natural, no soreness or fatigue, and you can now ride to the ends of the earth.  

After Day 3 you are broke in, have road stamina, and won‚Äôt have any further nagging soreness issues.  I asked some other riders while on my trip if they experience the same, and a few agreed. Others said no amount of time in the gym prepares them for a long trip.

"Hi all  


So on a recent ride, I managed to hit a gnarly pothole, and bent the front wheel on my '16 Z800.    
The damage isn't evident, but at about 50mph a very slight wobble starts, then goes away once the speed climbs over 55-56.  


I've already re-torqued the steering stem nut, re-balanced the wheel and tire, and EVEN got new tires (they were due for replacement, anyway).  None of this has cured that wobble, so a truing stand came out.  Sure enough, I have about a 1mm warp.  


Anybody got a spare wheel kicking around they're willing to part with?  
Ebay has tons of Chinese parts, which I'm more than a little leary of, or I can spend a ton on a part from the UK, but the cost and shipping would be as much as a new wheel assembly, here in the US-of-A.

Here are images of the damage: [https://imgur.com/a/OOgVbV3](https://imgur.com/a/OOgVbV3)

The techs at Harley-Davidson said the worst case scenario is bits of metal will break off, fall down, and lock up my steering. To fix it they said they would need to replace the entire frame (thousands of dollars). I asked if they could just drill / shave / clean off the problem parts and they said they were unwilling to do that.

Given that I've been riding the bike for so long without issue, and that spending thousands of dollars to fix a 10 year old bike doesn't make sense for me, I'm really hoping that either:

* Ignoring the damage is an adequate low-risk option, or...
* Finding a shop to clear out the damaged portions is an affordable option.

"Long story short, my oil was low so I went to put more in. 2013 honda shadow 600, so it takes 4 quarts to be full. Put in the funnel, started pouring oil. Thought it was only a little low, and assumed that once it was full, the oil would just... stop going down the funnel. well, I put in a quart, then a second, then almost a third, and I thought ""wow this was a LOT more empty than I thought!"" but the oil kept on going down the funnel and into the hole, so I thought it wasnt full yet.

Once I was getting close to the third quart, I thought, ""theres no way it could be this empty"" so I took the funnel out, and all of a sudden a TON of oil started pouring out of the hole. How is this possible? How can it pour out like that when the funnel is removed, but still go all the way down BELOW the bottom of the funnel when the funnel is in there?

What did I do wrong here? Did I put too much oil in? Will an engine even TAKE too much oil? Or, when it gets full, will it just stop taking any more oil? Like I would imagine that if its full, youd try to pour more oil and it would just sit in the funnel and not go down. But it DID keep going down, so why did it all pour back out when the funnel was removed? Everything I know about how fluids work tells me this shouldnt happen, but it did, so Im just confused as hell.

Right now, the oil comes all the way up to the very top of the hole where I would screw the cap in. Is this dangerous? Do I need to drain this out? or can I just screw the cap back on and call it good? I know obviously too little oil would be bad, but can a bike take ""too much"" oil? Wouldnt it just stop taking more oil once it was full? Like, if you put a funnel in a milk jug and pour in liquid, once the jug gets full the lkiquid will just sit in the funnel and not go down anymore. Why/how is this not the case with a bike?

Hoping someone had some similar issues and figured out a solution. I have a 2016 zx636 and a few weeks ago while I was riding it home after work it just turned off. I took it to a mechanic and they said the previous owner filled the tank too much and clogged the lines that allow the tank to vent the pressure. Since then it ran fine but today when I left I noticed the noise of the tank venting air and when I opened it there was a decent amount of pressure releases. When I started my ride it cut off again. When this happens I am able to start it but I have to hold the throttle while pressing the ignition. It seems like it‚Äôs only on the hotter days that this is an issue and I read it might have something to do with the gas cap. I also did just the tank the day before but I stopped it before it was completely full.

I looked at PDFs of the manuals for these two GPS devices, however, and both have device-specific mounting cradles, that include contacts for charging, and need to be hardwired into the bike's electrical system.  Both the Zumo 396 LMT-S and the Rider 550 do have USB sockets, but they seem intended for downloading updates and charging the device when it's dismounted, not keeping it charged up on the road.

It was a low-speed spill.  The impact was taken on my right forearm/elbow, shoulder, knee, and hip.  The padded armor in my jacket took the brunt, though my pants weren't so well equipped.   My right hip is a bit tender.  No blood on site, though.  That's good, right?

Strangely, it doesn't appear to be damaged...I swear to Dawg, not even a scuff in the bodywork (because it landed on me, I suspect)  The right mirror was cranked around, but that's a 14mm wrench and 2 minutes of work to put right, and the right bar-end is a little scratched up.  That's it.

The top case...well, who knows?  I've dropped it down the stairs to the garage a time or two.  No apparent cracks, though, and the hinge is in good shape.

The weirdest part?  
The only damage to my riding gear is the zipper on the LEFT sleeve cuff.  That blew out, though I'm not totally sure how.  The sleeves fit very snug...almost too tight... so I suppose it's possible that muscle contraction could have caused it to fail.

Anyway, the bike is still alive, I'm alive and sore, and the day goes on.  I ""get"" to replace a cool/wet weather riding jacket today.  Maybe add some pants into that mix, too.

Whee?

Have a good one, all y'all.  


\*\*Edit\*\*  
The jacket is replaced now, with a Scorpion EXO Optima.  They run a size big, which I was prepared for.  
The bike is fine.  Seriously, not even a broken turn signal.

1: It isn't the most comfortable thing in the world.
I came from riding ninja 300, fz6r, and KTM rc8.
This bike hurt my wrists for the first couple weeks until I got used to using my legs more. The seat is fine, probably better than most of it's class.

2: It depends on your experience level, and what you're used to riding. Thr turning circle is ATROCIOUS, compared to any bike you sit up more. Low speed control is possible, but it requires way more work. Above 5mph/8kph it rides easy. (Depending on your experience level)

3. With the slew of rider aids available (KRT also has ABS), the low power mode which limits the peak power to about 80 hp without affecting the low rpm performance (which is surprisingly good), great lights, and fairly light weight, it is very daily worthy. Not as good as most bikes made for more comfort, but probably the most daily-able bike in the 600ish class. I've ridden a 2020 R6 and that is not very daily friendly IMO.

At the end of the day, it's a smooth, surprisingly comfortable bike (for a supersport), so if you feel 140 hp is something you want/need/can handle, yes it is a good daily. However this bike shines when it's leaning over, best cornering bike I've ever had by a mile. It wants a race track to be happy.

It feels bumpy. And I can't figure out why. I don't think the wheel is bent, because the bumpyness doesn't seem to change rythm at all at different speeds. From 20mph to 70mph, it's the same rythm, more or less. It's just a constant rythm of bumps. At first i thought it might be the engine, but if I apply the clutch, nothing changes. So it has to be the wheels.  But they look fine.

"Bit of a long post, and not sure if this is the right sub, but hopefully i can give yall some decent info. this is my first bike, and i got the engine running, but having an electrical issue. The bike was handed down to me and has had some electrical modifications (dyna ignition instead of points, a throttle switch and a key switch installed). The previous owner gave me this paper which he said he followed for the electrical.
From what I can see he followed the diagram pretty well including the colors of the wires. There were a couple loose connections and the coils weren't hooked to anything so I fixed that up... I tried to follow the diagram and hooked the coils up to the same terminal on the switch as the black line that goes to the ""IG"" terminal of the regulator. This just blew the 30 amp fuse consistently. I then checked the other terminals of the switch, and found one that lit up when in the run position. I hooked coils up to that and got a running engine. So far so good. But then riding it, if the engine dies, it will either take a while for it to turn back on (me turning the key with no starter motor sound, and eventually turning on) or it will blow the fuse. I believe it's something with how the switch is wired. I found a diagram for the switch and the coils are actually hooked up to the ""accessory"" terminal.. this doesnt seem right, but the bike runs.. I noticed that my battery was running pretty low after running it for a while, so im considering changing out regulator and rectifier for a new reg-rectifier, and seeing if that helps. but the issue with the bike shorting the fuse when it stalls is still a bit of a mystery to me.. Im guessing it has something to do with the coils still drawing power from the accessory terminal while in the run position, but nothing else getting power, or something like that. I'm a bit of a novice with motorcycles and electrical work, so sorry if this is unclear or if a easy stupid mistake.

They've  since been waiting on a part to diagnose the issue my bike has. They  haven't done anything with my bike for almost two months.

Why  would an authorized dealer not have a diagnostic kit for a bike on the  showroom floor? Why is there no alternative to this? Things are seeming  shady at this point.

Called back today (the 20th) to see what was going on,  and found out they JUST started working on the issue. I'm beyond tired  of waiting, and have started looking into getting an attorney. At this  point the dealership has had the bike just about the same amount of time  I had it.  I just want a refund so I can look elsewhere next season.

"I have only been riding a year, but I might be done. The past couple day I have ridden my bike into work because I was getting brakes put on my car, I was too lazy to do it myself. My drive is about 40 minutes both ways, that‚Äôs not traffic time, I am about 35 miles away from work. The first morning on my way home it rained. I was unprepared for this as news said nothing but sun and clouds. I drive in back roads so it was random puddles. I have never been so stressed in my entire life. The second ride home it was foggy, very foggy, which doesn‚Äôt bother me, but the roads were mist covered and it just felt like the bike didn‚Äôt want to stay upright.  I checked all the usual suspects, tire pressure, fork bearings, tire wear, wobble in the wheels is non existent. Bike is solid. I could not get past the feeling I was just slipping and sliding all over the road despite being super cautious on speed and probably pissing everyone off behind me. Now I look at my bike and see stress. I am thinking of selling it, and because I do love to ride, maybe getting a (for shame) spyder so road conditions dont send me into freak out mode. I am sure 90% of what I was feeling was in my head and working myself up. But it‚Äôs there now. Ugh.",Might be done‚Ä¶,1.0,motorcycle,Don_Keebals,True

"Recently, the need for a 3rd Bluetooth comm device became apparent, given a wife AND daughter who like to ride with me.  Swapping between their respective helmets got to be a pain, especially when the kidlet decided we had to go ""NOW"".. (she can be a tad impatient, my girl...)  


So, I pulled the trigger on a newer Lexin device, the G16.  [AVAILABLE NOW! ALL NEW Lexin G16 16 Rider Intercom with Advanced Lexin - Lexin Electronics (lexin-moto.com)](https://lexin-moto.com/products/all-new-lexin-g16-16-rider-intercom-with-advanced-lexinpulse-sound-and-music-sharing)   
The best improvement is the clamping mechanism.  If you're familiar with earlier, other Lexin devices (such as the B4FM) you'll know what I'm talking about .  Installation was as easy as any other comm device on the market.  


Sound quality at rest is much better than the prior device (again the B4FM, which wasn't bad though certainly not stellar)  The bass is at least registerable, and the treble is less pronounced.  Given that I wear earplugs, it will be an overall improvement in sound quality.    


I already know that the thing will be waterproof.  I've ridden in Seattle downpours using  the earlier device, with zero loss of function or reliability.  My faith is unshaken, in that regard.  


Anyway, like I said, a short-short review, mostly cuz I'm bored and can't go ride yet.  Chest colds suck (I'm fully Covid vaxxed) and coughing or sneezing into your helmet is just nasty.

"Alright so first off: long time lurker from a backwater 3rd world country where the only things the average citizen can get (both in motorcycles per se and it's spare parts) are mopeds, Suzuki AX100 knockoffs and like 6 different makes for the same CG150/CG200 motorcycles, aside from Suzuki's EN and GN 125's and 150's.

&amp;#x200B;

So I got a Pagsta/Regal Raptor MC 100CC, uses the same engine as the Honda Cub/SuperCub or some kinds of ATVs I've seen here. It was an old pile of dirt, ""working"" but not quite. It's an ""automatic"" but it has an automatic clutch, rest of the gearbox is manual but no foot selector nor hand clutch.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't quite know much about motorcycles when I bought it on February, so I thought it was gonna be easier to get it running. All in all and not to fall on too many details; I replaced the piston head and it's rings, then the entire block (cylinder, camshaft, chamber, timing chain gears) and ""upgraded"" to a 110cc cylinder, currently waiting on a 125cc one I bought online, then the entire inside of the gearbox since the 2nd gear kinda grinded itself together to the main shaft. Then I had to convert the entire thing to 12v to use an electronic CDI. It's running, it's getting me where I need to go and it's teaching me what I need to know for when I get something bigger.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, I just wanted to say that I'm proud of it even though it's given me more trouble than peace of mind but it's well on it's way to flip that over. Still needs aesthetic and electronic (lights and starter) and a carb change since this one (a CG150's carb) is fouling them too quick.

Tried push starting after starter wouldn‚Äôt turn and the tire was locking up unless in 4th or 5th gear. Lights dimmed showing that the connections and solenoid were working so I thought started was stuck. Replaced it and didn‚Äôt work. So I left it connected but not engaged to the flywheel grounded it to my rear brake pedal and the starter spun. I ended up trying to turn the crank to see if engine was frozen somehow. Turned it and I had to push really hard until there was a snapping sound and then it was moving freely. Went to start it and after 5 seconds and a couple attempts it started. Shut it off and a couple days later road it around ended up hearing what sounded like a backfire through the carb and then a minute later what sounded like a misfire where the piston was still going up as ignition went off but I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs what it was. Like when a bullet hits steel targets high pitch ping. Ended up riding it to my destination turning it off and it not starting. Starter turned a short bit without start before it stopped and sounded like it was stuck. Tried turning the crank and it felt free. Came back next day to push start and it felt locked up. I‚Äôm assuming I need to take the engine totally apart but I don‚Äôt know how it could be frozen then snap sound like that and be able to start without total engine failure. Any ideas what‚Äôs wrong?

"Hi folks, I am getting my licence in a couple of months and I like the looks and relatively upright riding position of naked bikes. I really like the Kawasaki ER6N and can find them used around here for a good price. I am planning on doing 70% of riding around the city, but I am also planning on doing some longer trips (500km +). I have two concerns:

1) How do the naked bikes (and specifically er6n) perform on the motorway in terms of rider comfort? I am expecting some wind (otherwise I would just drive a car) but how tiring does it get on longer drives?

2) I am a rather tall guy (193 cm or 6 foot 4), will I manage to fit on the er6n? If not, do you have any other suggestions, or mods that will improve the comfort?

"Hello,

I'm looking for ideas for a 2nd bike. I'm still riding my first bike (2003 1st Gen KLR650) for the last 3yrs. It's a nice bike but it's very weak with about 40hp and top speed of 90mh. My KLR was great for commuting to work and school, but I'm looking for a bike I can also take to the track once in a while. 

I'm a big guy at 6'2"" and about 240lb. I'm looking at a Suzuki SV650, SV1000, and a Yamaha FZ1 or FZ6. I'm also looking at the Ninja 650, but I'm open to ideas. I've been looking at these bikes due to the more upright seating position and ability to add a GIVI top box. 

What do you guys think? Should I be more open to a traditional 600 or liter bike (pick your brand)?

Thank you for helping me in my search. One more thing I'm positive I'll be buying used and not new.

I need some help deciding on some soft luggage because I don't like the classic leather or plastic hard luggage and I don't really know if they are compatible with my bike. I have an sportster from 1999, it is this one:

Honestly not sure if gz250 is considered a cruiser or if it‚Äôs just cruiseresque. But I was wanting to get a more grippy sport/touring tire or sport tire. One thing that makes me hesitant is that I saw that a cruiser generally doesn‚Äôt need the extra grip from these types of tires because the clearance of a cruiser is an issue way before a tire like that and a cruiser tire is more than enough grip for what the bike can handle. Is this referring more to bikes with footrests that scrape before you‚Äôre barely even leaning? Because I feel my gz250 besides low hanging pegs which can of course fold up has almost as much clearance as a sport bike. I‚Äôm looking for something that will not turn to dust in 3000 miles but is also grippier than something that makes me low side only after a tad more lean angle than scraping the pegs. Sorry if this is an obvious question I‚Äôm a noobie who‚Äôs just trying to practice getting comfortable with more lean on tires that won‚Äôt slide out like that like what I have now. I have a 3 year old tire so I‚Äôm sure any new tire would help but I‚Äôd like to hear your thoughts about sport tires on a ‚Äúcruiser‚Äù being pointless because of reason stated above.

"Hey, I just bought my first motorcycle, a 1982 cb750 from my houses previous tenants for $650. It ran fine with only a charging issue until I connected the wrong leads to the battery and got some electrical smoke as a response. After connecting the leads correctly it ran for a few days and I had a mechanic look over it briefly and they said that mechanically it was sound. That brings us to today when I tried to start it and it wouldn't get power. I checked the main fuse and it wasn't a fuse, but rather a piece of wire. 

My question is what is most likely wrong or what should I test to see what's wrong?

also I already know I'm an idiot for,

A: buying a big first bike

B: buying a project

"Hey guys, first let me start by saying I'm a first time rider, I just bought my first bike, and while I'm pretty mechanically inclined, I still have alot to learn. 

I'm not sure if this is the subreddit I should post this in, if not I'm sure someone will tell me, but I'm having some trouble with my bike I just bought. 

The bike is a 2001 kawasaki EX500r, it has 16k miles on it, and next to no damage on the body other than very small paint scratches. 

I get it home, buy a new battery and trickle charge it to full, and drop it in the bike, I start it and it cranks, but it doesn't turn over and run. I check the oil and the gage on the side that's like a window to show how full it is, and its at like 80% full so it's not full, full, but I wouldn't think that would be what's preventing it from starting. 

The owner said he hadn't drove it in like 2 years, so I figured it'd crank a bit before starting but it wouldn't start at all and I'm not quite sure where to go from here. 

Through some online searching I guess a compression test would be the first thing, so I'll probably try that. 

Tldr; basically I'm just asking for what would like a checklist of things to do to get it to start, AND is this a known issue with kawasaki? Or this model?",Bike cranks but doesn't start,1.0,motorcycle,DrShackles12,True

"Hi guys,  I'm 24F and I've been riding for 6 years now. 
I also have had 5 bikes, all Honda,  from cbr125r to 600f 2016 (my last one)

I'm writing this with a broken spine (T6&amp;T7) that happened 2 weeks ago.

I was riding in Austria in a very boring corner (80 km/h) when for no reason my back tire slipped away (I have it all on video) and after half a second of sliding I fell down a cliff for 30 meters. I laid there for 40 minutes unable to move and screaming for help,  which came after a fireman saw my mirror on the road. 
It was a living hel. I prayed and I'm so lucky I don't have any damage that won't go away with time. My bike is written off and I'm laying down on the bed for most of the time with quite some painkillers. 

My bf is going for his license now and he had a heart to heart with me preferring I don't ride again because I got damn lucky. 
Doctors told me that if I moved my spleen would've ruptured more and I'd bleed to death and I should've been paralysed.

My family and friends that were there for me all don't want me to ride again because this can happen but I feel like it's the same with a horse.  You get knocked off once but you need to get back on again.

Both have roughly similar cost but I‚Äôm really confused which to choose. R6 has better sound but cbr is more comfortable.

"Shadow 750 or vtx 1300

Hi, I got my license recently and looking to buy a bike. I wanted to go with honda and those are my 2 options.

I‚Äôm 6‚Äô 200 pounds and i feel really good on a 750 that I‚Äôve tried. I rode rebel 300, harley street 500 and test drove the 750 (only thing is it felt like it‚Äôs not geared for highway speeds). I don‚Äôt really need more power but i‚Äôm looking for comfort too. Every bikeI tried felt pretty easy to ride and I‚Äôm wondering if I will want to change the shadow soon if I get it.

I‚Äôm confident in my skills to get the vtx as my first bike but i‚Äôm wondering what you guys think about both bikes and about known issues they could have if any.

Note: there is only one vtx in my area and I don't know if it's a 1300 or a 1800. The one I will go see next week has 60k kms and is priced 4k CAD

The shadow I test drove had 130k kms and had about half an inch thick of papers about maintenance history and receipts. Is advertised at 2k CAD.

Thanks a lot for your help, as always!

"1975 I had purchased a used Yamaha motorcycle. I finally got my permit and was able to legally ride it on the street, after months of working on it in my garage and being limited to putting around the dirt fields near my home.

But finally, I was on my first ride, 15 minutes and 5 mi away from my home, when I came into a corner marked 15 miles an hour at a big healthy fat amount over 25 miles an hour...

...stomping the rear brake like a rank amateur, I lost traction and slid to the outside of the curb, ending up in the front yard of a house.

There was an old man sitting on the front porch. When my bike stopped running in the dust cleared, as I stood up, he asked if I was okay.

I kind of beat the dust off my legs and realized I'd ruined a good pair of boots but I picked up my bike and it seemed to be okay and I said, ""I think I'm all right.""

They look like [these](https://media.autoexpress.co.uk/image/private/s--vFg0Dd34--/v1563183350/autoexpress/2017/11/1_27.jpg)

I have an Aprilia SX 125 (2 stroke), but not the original rims. So that's why I kinda don't know what sprocket to look for.

&amp;#x200B;

Picture of my [rims and sprocket](https://imgur.com/gallery/ignHssZ)

&amp;#x200B;

So that sprocket should fit the rims, and i'm looking for a bigger sprocket and don't want to order that one since I already have that.

&amp;#x200B;

The only one I found is ""Jtr703"". It says that it should fit the aprilia rs 125 2006-2011, most likely the same rims I have, but when comparing the pictures of the sprockets, the jtr703 seems to have different measurements, like the hole in the middle seems way smaller, the holes for the bolts seem similar though.

Comparison:

Same earlier pics of my [rims and sprocket](https://imgur.com/gallery/ignHssZ)

&amp;#x200B;

I can't find the measurements of the original sprocket literally anywhere so i'm really lost and out of luck. The code and model number of the original seem to be ""4396"" and ""AP8107166"".

I keep finding some places that sell the OEM sprocket, but I don't want that because they only sell 40 tooth sprockets, and I'm looking for a bigger one, 45-50.

"Hey guys, I‚Äôm new to riding. I just bought a 2020 Honda rebel 500.
I have been riding but I noticed that I‚Äôm not that great.I have so many unanswered questions 

1- when do I shift gears ? The manual recommends 1st to 2nd (20km/h)
2nd to 3rd (30km/h)
3rd to 4th (40km/h)
Etc
Do I need to follow exactly these guidelines or can I shift let‚Äôs say from 3rd to 4th at like 35km/h instead of 30km/h ?
I honestly can‚Äôt really tell by the sound it makes when to change gears. Does it have to really start being agressive and loud for me to switch gears ?
Btw: my bike does not give me the rpms 

2-when it comes to downshifting (I see a stop sign ahead) do I need to match every time the km/h I‚Äôm at ? Ex: I‚Äôm going 60 and at 50 I downshift to 5- at 40 I downshift to 4, etc ?
Or can I just shift one by one without checking how fast I‚Äôm going so I could eventually go into 1st gear once I‚Äôm completely stopped ?

3- do you guys recommend I brake first  for a stop sign or shift gears then brake ?

4- if I‚Äôm going 70 and then there‚Äôs a curve and I need to turn do I have to get to 20-25km/h and then downshift to 2 in order to take the curve ?

"So I consider myself sort of beginner to bikes and I only started riding again 2 weeks ago. (Just for background I have my license now for 5 years but didn‚Äôt ride most of that time).

On the past 2 weeks I limit myself on riding just inside our town. Which is 60kph (37.2mph) limit.

I practiced low speed manoeuvring, safe riding, and basically getting used to the bike overall.

Today it was my first time riding outside my town. I went on a 30km ride on 80kph (50mph) limit road. Going to my destination was amazing.  Since it was sunday, there wasn‚Äôt a lot of cars. The road also had twists which is hella fun.

Anyways, going back to town is the same until a caravan behind me was sitting on my ass.

I sped up just a little bit so I‚Äôm going roughly 85kph on a 80 zone and they‚Äôre still tailgaiting me. It was only lane one road and I don‚Äôt think they can overtake since it‚Äôs a solid double line for the other side of the road. 

I was stressing out and by the time I looked down on my dash, i was going past 100kph, that‚Äôs 20 over the limit and they‚Äôre still right behind me. 

I panicked and immediately stopped on the side of the road to let them pass.

"!TLDR: looking at adventure/ dualsports, want one for highway but can handle dirt roads with ease. Dont know anything of finacing, need help there. Trying to find something that can be mostly worked on with a toolkit/ electrical kit in a backpack.

Howdy! New to buying a bike on finance, so trying find something worthy of actually finacing and owning for the longrun, being I'd like to find something to commute with (average 5 mile- 200 mile) while having damn near the swiss army knife of bikes that can so mostly anything, with simplicity and reliabilty to boot.

Recently I've been looking at dual sports and adventure bikes; kawasaki's KLR's, Suzukis DR's, Yamaha's Tenere and Honda's Twin Africans. Dual sports favoring the dirt while Adventures sweet spots are looking more for the highway; but the contrast being that adventures are more and more technically advanced and not so bush-craft mechanic friendly, while Dualsports are dirt bikes with a beefier electrical system to power up the road-going bits. I do want something that can handle the 75 mph of the interstates here, but at the same time; should I want to take some random trail in the sticks or be faced with a poorly maintained dirt road thats just went through a weeks worth of rain I can tackle it as well opposed to having to shy away from it. 

Weather is of little issue as in the past through dirt biking and touring with an 87 Shadow ive invested in a good set of weather gear

Reliability/ servicability is a must. Short of rebuilding the engine, I carry almost a full toolkit/ electrical kit after having to work on the Shadow a good bit, and I do enjoy the fact that so as long as I can get the part, I can work on it and replace it. Fancy electronics and ECU's that are nice to have are also something that has to be brought to the dealer if they break; unless shop tools  on excess of thousands of dollars are bought soley for that bike: something I do not have the money for.  The lesser the bike thinks, the better! I'm not a strager to working on the bike, so changng out sprockets, working the suspension diffrently, jetting carbs to suit diffrent styles of riding isnt out of hand. 

Finally.... Financing. This is an endeavor I've never touched being all bikes I've had where 15+ years old and had to be brought back to life, and where all bought outright being they where under 1k.

My credits pretty well, around the 750's to 800's. Ive a decent amount of money saved up, so I can afford something of a down payment; but thats with plenty of saving. I make something like 25k a year? So cheaper is better.

We‚Äôre sure you‚Äôve heard the term ‚Äòlow and slow‚Äô and we endorse that message. 

It‚Äôs ALWAYS best to start with a smaller dosage and gradually increase it while observing your tolerance, and the effect of the CBD on the condition you are treating.

Starting dosage could be 15 to 40 mg per day. After one week, increase it by 5 mg. Keep doing this until you feel that it is effectively treating your symptoms.

"Hello there, I am from Bangladesh and I have a motorbike called ""**Suzuki Gixxer 155cc 2014**"".

My bike has a ground clearance of **160mm**. Problem is I often get pounded at the bottom part of my bike in many uneven speed breaker in my country due to this very short ground clearance.

Many in our country has overcame this issue by simply upgrading the rear tire size from **140/60-R17** to **140/70-R17**. But I know this will cause another problem, **false reading in the speedometer**.

There are very few resources in my country, so **I can't calibrate the speedometer or make any complex customization to the speedometer** to make the reading right. So I came with another plan.

My stock engine sprocket has **15T** and drive sprocket has **45T**. Stock rear tire is **140/60-R17**. I have my ""**speed reader**""(I don't know the exact name of it) at the **engine sprocket.**

So, for **stock rear tire** the overall diameter is **599.8mm** with a circumference of **1884.327mm.**

If I change the tire size from **140/60-R17** to **140/70-R17**, then the overall diameter is **627.8mm** with a circumference of **1972.292mm.**

By the unitary rules--

* Circumference ---&gt; Engine Sprocket(front) ---&gt; Drive Sprocket(rear)
* 1884.327mm ---&gt; 15T ---&gt; 45T
* 1mm ---&gt; 15T ---&gt; (45T/1884.327mm)
* 1972.292mm ---&gt; 15T ---&gt; (45T X 1972.292mm)/1884.327mm

= 47.100T ‚âà **47T**

I know the power distribution will be low. I don't care about the top speed either. Just want to **make sure the speedometer read the correct distance I am travelling**.

# So, if I change the stock chain sprocket from 15T/45T to 15T/47T and stock rear tire from 140/60-R17 to 140/70-R17, will it show the correct reading in the speedometer?",Stock 15T/45T to 15T/47T and stock 140/60-R17 to 140/70-R17,1.0,motorcycle,AkasH5ky,True
"I've seen quite a lot of posts and comments about motorcycle gear and some things came to my attention, so I thought I post my opinion about it.

Riding ATGATT is a good thing, no question about it. If you have the discipline to do it, hats off to you! Personally, I wear all the gear if I specifically go out to ride. If it's less than 50km, i skip wearing motorcycle pants (depends on the weather) and wear jeans. Sometimes I ride with jeans and a T-shirt when I just ride around the city wanting to get somewhere with speeds not exceeding 60kph.

The thing that came to my attention is that some people don't prioritize the order gear in the right way - at least not the way I would do it, I could be wrong. I'm specifically thinking about a post saying the rider bought the boots last, as they thought boots are the least important.

The helmet is most important. I heard some states in the US allow riding without a helmet. Please wear a full face helmet at all times, you really don't want to sit in a wheelchair drooling for the rest of your life or arguably even worse: dying. The next most important piece of gear for me would either be gloves or boots (order could be argued). If you fall, your hands will instinctively be the first thing that touch the ground in most cases - redditors often tell you that you dont want your partner to wipe your ass for months after an accident. The boots are important because statistically motorcyclists tend to break their ankles a lot on low speed accidents (bike tipping over at a traffic light, etc.). After helmet, boots and gloves I think the jacket is the next most important piece of gear. Your thorax/upper body is the center of gravity of your body and will probably ""recieve"" the most road rash. The least important are pants. Of course, road rash can be really bad on your legs too - but if I had to choose all pieces of gear except for one, I would  decide to not wear pants. If you look at the sources, the data will prove that rib, tibia, fibula, patella and femur fractures are more common than foot fractures. But I feel like there is not too much you can do against rib, tibia, femur and fibula fractures (knee pads to protect your patella). I would bet my house on boots preventing a lot of foot fractures, though. Thats why I would rank proper boots higher than motorcycle pants or jackets.

To summarize - my opinion ranking gear from most to least important:

1. helmet
2. boots/gloves
3. jacket
4. pants

I wrote this post with a mixture of statistics and common sense. Please point out if I misinterpreted statistics or if my thinking is flawed. Maybe you found statistics proving things differently. I would love to hear your opinion on this.

"Hi-  20+ year rider here. 
Something that‚Äôs been on my mind a lot this season. I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of angry people on bikes. We are all representatives of motorcyclists when we are out on the roads. That means we are ambassadors of the lifestyle.

"So basically I'm split between buying a Yamaha YBR 125 and a Kymco Zing 125. I'm looking at a really tight budget, as this bike is only supposed to last me two years maximum, as I live in Europe and this is only temporary before I turn 18 and get a car (I'm currently 16), so these two are pretty much my only options.

Here are pros and cons of each bike as I see them:

**Yamaha YBR 125**

Pros: Is a cheap and a safe choice, is sure to last the time interval I want it to, I have heard it is very high quality, pretty much no risk taken.

Cons: I'm currently getting my drivers licence and my drivers school has me riding a Yamaha YBR for practice already, but I honestly find the bike really boring, basic, with not exactly the best design (not necessarily the worst either though), also, as I've already mentioned, I'm 16, so the bike is mostly needed for me to just get around some relatively short distances and have fun doing dumb stuff, and I kind of feel like a YBR will fall short in that other aspect.

**Kymco Zing 125**

Pros: Looks and sounds much better in my opinion, I personally find it to be a much cooler bike. It also seems to me like it could handle much better if I just started screwing around and do something stupid.

Cons: As much as I like the design of it more than YBR, I just can't stop associating it to some bearded Texan metalheads who drive without even decent breaks, and I feel like I'll look like that to everybody else on it, but that's the least of my concern, as I feel like I'll grow to hate it even over the course of those two years. It's a much riskier option, and while I like it a bit more right now, I just can't be sure how I'll feel about it in the future.

Just to mention, if it wasn't clear already, I'm actually not that much into motorcycles, nor do I understand them, I'm just buying one because it's the best vehicle I can legally ride for my age, before I can drive a car, as I've already said.

"Hello, i have an issue with the choke on my  f650 funduro, before changing exhaust, i would need to use the choke on cold starts, then once warm i turned it off, like it should be

&amp;#x200B;

After changing exhaust, i was running lean on the idle. And stalling on decel, lots of popping in the exhaust too.

&amp;#x200B;

Manual calls for the idle screw to be 3.5 turns out from bottomed out.

&amp;#x200B;

I tuned mine to 3 turns out, popping on decel is mostly gone, when i start her up tho, if i pull the choke, even very slightly, it will kill it! The only way to start her is with the choke off, rev up the engine for like a minute, then she can idle on her own without choke.

&amp;#x200B;

Why is this happening? How could i be rich with a new performance exhaust and only 3 turns out when the manual calls for 3.5 on the idle screw? if anything now it would need to be more out since it needs to be richer.

&amp;#x200B;

Plugs look slightly lean actually. It doesn't really bother me, since it will idle just fine it just need a bit of gas for a few seconds, if i start to pull the choke, it will start bogging down and die.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope i explained property, any ideas?

&amp;#x200B;

also, i can't adjust the idle the right way (finding the highest idle) since i can only adjust the idle screw with the engine cold, otherwise there is no way to stick your hand under the carb and turn the screw with the engine hot. planning to get a idle mix screw with a long knob so i can do proper adjustment, but right now  this is what it is.","bike stalls with choke on, cold start",1.0,motorcycle,redditmodsneckbeards,True

The things that I know so far:

- This random movement only occurs when im giving no throttle or very little (when the bike is in a gear). When I use my clutch or the bike is in neutral, the chain is normal.

- The engine itself is running smooth and doesn‚Äôt have any hiccups

- The chain is loose in the video but tightening doesn‚Äôt solve the problem

"Hey everyone,

Curious to hear your opinions on the boosterplug as a remedy to the low speed/low RPM jerkiness that a lot of modern EFI bikes have due to lean AFR conditions. Also as a remedy to overall richen AFR as a counter measure to adding on small mods such as slip-on's, which may slightly lean a bike out.

Allegedly the boosterplug will richen the fuel mixture 6% by tricking the ECU into thinking air temp is cooler than it really is. It only does this when the ECU is in open loop mode which occurs at low RPM, acceleration, and deceleration. However, the boosterplug has no effect during closed loop mode operation such as cruising with steady throttle. This allows richer fuel mixture during modulation of speed and low RPM, while letting the bike resume a leaner condition in cruise for fuel economy.

For my bike (z400), the booster Plug would drop AFR into a range between 12.5-13.0 throughout most of my RPM range, with the lowest spot being a brief dip to 12.2AFR at around 7k RPM. (Is 12.2 too rich for start of powerband?) Low RPM AFR should improve drastically from being in mid 14's to now in the mid 13's, which should smooth out the jerky throttle that plagues EFI bikes which are lean from factory. Any thoughts on the boosterplug solution? To me it seems like a cheaper/less precise way of fuel tuning, but accurate enough to resolve the issues above without having to pay for a proper tune.",Booster Plug to fix lean conditions?,1.0,motorcycle,housenoob2020,True

So my bike got fixed. The air intake wasn‚Äôt connected. I zip around the apartment complex for a little bit. Decide  That I want an apple juice. Store is right up the block. A 3 minute walk.

I just need to make one left turn onto the street. And one right turn to get into the parking lot. Simple. Then I realize that I‚Äôm situated on a slight incline. And I can‚Äôt get the bike to go up the incline to save my ass. I stall 5 times. Cars are lining up behind me. They are impatient. They look angry. My nerves are getting the best of me.

I constantly end up commiting mistakes when trying to get the bike going initially, to brake, to turn left or right. Even now sometimes I forget I need to hold the clutch lever when the bike is at gear one, or am too slow to stop the motorcycle as having to let go of the accelerator, hold the clutch lever, go to gear 1, and just then you can start to brake is too much to think about in less than a second. Also when I try to accelerate from a stop I try to get the clutch lever half way through and accelerate just a little at the same time, but most of the time I don't get the clutch to the right spot or turn the accelerator too much.

"So basically my situation is as follows.

Started riding last year and as my dad is big into Hondas and has a VFR1200, he basically talked me into VFR800 VTEC and been riding that since. Whole year I've ridden that thing alot, there was basically snow on the ground when I took it out for it's first spin this spring and I just love riding alot.

But now with 14k kilometers of experience on a big bike with decent power I've come to think that a smaller, slower bike would be a lot of fun. Tried my friends CB600 Hornet and damn it felt like a bicycle compared to the VFR and ever since I've been thinking a lighter bike would be so damn fun. 

Been eyeing MT-07's ever since, love the supermoto/naked looks and seems to have a ton of torgue for it's overall power. 

Two reasons for biking down, first being the fact I'm a trucker so basically losing my license over speeding on a big bike would also lose me my job, and overall never really enjoyed going fast. And it's the only fun thing on VFR besides touring. I don't do touring at all, and if the itch sometimes comes and decide to take a trip I could use my dads VFR.

Second being I just love back-road blasting, and the MT-07 seems to fit that niche better than many other bikes. Also learning wheelies sounds fun, don't really wanna do them with current ride since it weights a fuckton.

I've read some stories of people getting bored of MT07's, do you think I'd get bored with it?

How's the quality compared to Honda, alot of maintance to do? Have basically done nothing to VFR over the year exept oil and filter change since it's so bulletproof. And my dad will give me shit for doing anything else than a Honda so I'd love to prove him wrong :D

Also, how's driving with a passenger? My wife occasionally jumps on for short drives (100-200km's) every now and then. Does MT-07 slouch under load?

I took the msf course and it was good and I passed fine but once I got my bike I realized I still was confused about some stuff:

1. When stoped at a light. I keep the bike in first and hold the clutch. I‚Äôve read that this can hurt the clutch. Should I keep it in first and just hold the rear brake? Will it hold the rpms and take off fine when I give it throttle? Seems to make sense to me just in case I need to take off fast.  (Kind of stalled on a uphill left turn :( )

2. In msf we only upshifted to second. What I did was release throttle, clutch, shift and release clutch fast like I just let go of it. Felt fine. Should I be doing that normally or do I let go of it slower or what? 

3. Say I‚Äôm in going 45 in 6th gear and am slowing to a stop. I just hold clutch, and shift 5,4,3,2,1 as I come stop. Entire time clutch in engaged. Is that okay? Or should I clutch downshift release clutch downshift release and so on?

Sorry for the newbie questions I just want to make sure I‚Äôm doing this right. Thanks!",Question about shifting/clutch use,1.0,motorcycle,SmoothMarionberry551,True

Bike dies after starting. Need help.

Bike info : 
2015 FZ07 about 30k miles
 Rotella T6 for last 5k miles 
Full Yoshi Exhaust
Pretty sure it‚Äôs been reflashed (has Hordpower sticker on the side of ECU)

So I got back from a ride last night, bike ran perfectly during the ride. Get home shut the bike off. Turn the bike back on and check engine light comes on, I wait a few minutes and it doesn‚Äôt go off. So I kill the bike and restart it, the check engine is now gone. I now have the problem of the bike not wanting to stay on. I have since changed the oil and oil filter. Siphoned the gas out and added new gas (92 octane) and added fuel system cleaner. Air filters were replaced very recently (50miles ago) and I‚Äôve checked them, they aren‚Äôt clogged or anything like that. I‚Äôve asked some of my friends and they have said to check spark plugs next. Wanted to get some opinions from more mechanically inclined people before I start taking stuff apart to get the spark plugs out. Attached is a video of the bike as it sits right now. It starts but dies after 30seconds. Any info or ideas on what could be causing this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

Edit: I have since changed spark plugs and still have the same issue, now I noticed a clicking/sucking sound coming from under the tank area. Will upload video soon if the sound. Replacing the fuel pump will probably be next.

Edit 2: 
https://youtube.com/shorts/IfEZn3yfS0s?feature=share
The second time I start it I hold the revs. Can you tell what the clicking sound is ? I‚Äôm confident that‚Äôs the source of the problem. Sounds to me a throttle body thing but I‚Äôm not very mechanically inclined. I have also since replaced the battery with a new one, checked all the fuses and glued my tip over sensor.

"So I just brought a 2015 Street 500. It‚Äôs my first bike. I‚Äôm totally uncomfortable riding on the street so today after it was delivered to me I zipped around my apartment complex. I was practicing making a right hand turn from a dead stop as if I was at a stop sign or red light. I fixated on a curb that didn‚Äôt want to hit and consequently hit it. I didn‚Äôt hit it hard. I had sense enough to brake before I hit it too hard. The clutch went into some mulch, the peg and my left leg kept the bike from slamming into the ground. I hit the kill switch. Picked her up. Examined her she had no cosmetic damage outside of a scraped clutch. No leaks. Nothing. I tried to start her she wouldn‚Äôt start so I waddled her to safe location. After 2 minutes she started then killed when I tried to shift to 1st. I began waddling her to where I keep her parked. I started her she went to first and I could coast her in. The check engine light came on. I asked some buddies who ride they said it sounds like a sensitive tip over sensor and to let her cool off. I waited 2 hours before starting her up again. Now she sounds like she‚Äôs skipping/trying to rev on her own before eventually dying while in neutral. And that pesky check engine light is still on. If I twist the throttle and hold a bit she doesn‚Äôt kill. But if I let go she starts skipping again (sounds like a bass drum hitting doubles with a pause in between) and then she dies. Someone else thinks that my throttle cable is a little loose and that‚Äôs why she‚Äôs choking and dying but that‚Äôs on the right side and my bike was laid down on its left side. But I can fiddle with the throttle cable and flex it with my finger. Any ideas on what may be wrong or should I just have her towed to the shop and have them diagnose it??

"I'm making a post for others that might have the same issue I and so many more have run into without any direct answer from forums, mechanics, videos, books, ect. I'm not sure if the same fix relates to the 650's but I cant see why not. For me this wasn't just clean your carbs, tune and it's fixed. This is also for a basically stock bike, modified intakes and exhaust may cause your jets to need to be bigger and you're getting lean hang. I'm not getting into that, though that's on you. I would also like to say I am not responsible for any damages to yourself or your own motorcycle, I'm just a shade tree mechanic willing to help some fellow riders.

Thanks

\-A breakdown of what happened to me and something to compare, skip forward but it may help you notice signs before it happens.

   It could be a simple lean hang or you could have this weird electrical issue I'm not entirely 100% what causes it. I think it starts from a mix of bad gas and warmer humid weather change because thats the only thing I noticed that changed and how drastically fast it happened.

My bike was a little leaner, air/fuel screw 1.5 turns out  for the spring time and ran beautifully, idle nice and low, rumbly, but I started noticing an afterfire on cold starts with the weather getting warmer and quite a few more while decelerating than usual, I didn't pay any mind, I like the little pops and bangs. This is where you should be listening to your bike because it was a bit too excessive. I noticed after a long ride my front exhuast had blued a little, Yes I was leaner for the warm weather but I didn't get into the carbs yet and the fuel should have been richer by now

I had just changed my oil and filter that night and used 20w-50 for the hotter temperatures. Filled my tank the night before and took the bike to work the next morning, about 15¬∞ warmer than the day before and just rained that night, first day it got over 90¬∞. Bike started first try sounded a little more tinny than usual but took it as its just not warmed up yet. I got on the highway and stalled doing 65, figured I need to get some more fuel in the carbs. Started the bike back up after a few tries and it felt terrible. Throttle response was chugging and then ripped off like it just dumped carb cleaner in it, pulled the clutch on the off ramp and the rpms went way up and hung like something was sticking open (keep that in mind). I made it to work and when I got off the bike would NOT start and I never had an issue starting it. Eventually I roll started it with the enrichener/choke fully open and it was not a happy sounding bike. Rode the slow way home and coming to every stop the rpms would raise way up and hang in gear and neutral with no load on the engine, as soon as I stopped the rpms would come back down but the idle sounded terrible. If I rocked the bike back and forth they would rise again drastically until the bike stopped moving. Got home put the bike on a jack, rolled the rear wheel and rpms would rise, as soon as I stopped it they would drop so I thought it had to be electrical but it isn't entirely. Found a couple posts about the TPS sensor causing issues and that's when my brain started frying from the late nights to fix this issue. Somehow your TPS, Idle speed, ignition and speed sensor correlate altogether and I assume the ECM gets confused and our v stars don't have a diagnostic mode to reset.

Most things are simple enough but I'll break down all of the steps I did to help anyone willing to do this. If you are not mechanically inclined and you have zero idea how to work on carbs or read a multimeter yes take it to a mechanic. There are very small parts and they are easy to lose, otherwise work on and bond with your bike. Don't just run seafoam and expect results, your issue will come back.

#        ------THE FIX THAT WORKED FOR ME------

Firstly, remove your seat and tank, air box, throttle cables, disconnect your battery, unplug TPS (be careful, that is an expensive sensor) and carb heater connections, remove your carbs, lightly plug your intake holes with paper towels, split the carbs apart and start disassembling individually. If anything can come out or off within reason, leave things such as your idle screw and choke brackets, throttle linkage alone and clean any brass, aluminum, metal parts with carb cleaner (do not clean rubber, plastic, or paint with carb cleaner, it will eat it)  and compressed air gently though as not to lose anything.

I used the [All Balls carb rebuild kit](https://www.partsgiant.com/p383769-all-balls-carburetor-rebuild-kit?f=116733), don't buy the $20 one on ebay or amazon just becuase its cheaper, this is the heart of your engine, do it once and do it right. Even if you don't think you need to change something, CHANGE IT! Save the time of taking them out multiple times and save your old parts for when you need them. My floats were good so I reused them and set them to correct height

Double check that your enrichener plungers/choke are not sticking at all, so that move freely and snap back into place. One of mine that I thought was fully seated was not and had a very small burr inside that I dremeled off VERY carefully and lightly sanded the plunger the with 800 grit sandpaper. afterwards I heavily sprayed  that spot with carb cleaner, aside from that nothing was obvious of being a failure point or clogged.

When you are confident that you have changed everything with zero new parts left over or lost, lightly seat your air/ screws in until you feel a small amount of pressure, any more and you will rip the o ring in there, digging it out isn't fun a second time. Unscrew them back to factory 2 1/2 turns out, you can tune them at a later time. Afterwards, I'm sure this isn't for everyone but I lightly spray my moving parts with a silicone lube. Each to their own

Since your carbs are out and finished, its a good time to check your valve clearance, One video is included in the playlist. Doing this isn't detrimental but its easy enough and worth your time since everything is open now, the rear one is a pain though.

Make sure the you are not missing the vacuum plug on the front cylinder carb. If you are make one or buy a vacuum plug assortment from the auto store, while your there pick up some good spark plugs and replace them blow some compressed air in the hole before you remove the plugs you don't  have any debris fall in. The spark plugs are 22 mm socket and you may need to get creative on the socket adapters to use. (make sure you unscrew the spark plug cap on the top (I definitely didn't forget that.....) a tip I use for difficult spark plugs is use a piece of rubber hose attached on the top to get the threads started and then you can put your socket on it.

You can now put your carbs in, a small amount of silicone lube helps a lot. Attach your cables and fuel lines Make sure your throttle has a small amount of play, snap your throttle back a couple times and recheck the play. Plug in TPS and carb heater connections and reconnect your battery, your ECM should have had enough time for a soft reset by now. If you are using your stock air box make sure the air breather under your air box is attached to the hose on the front of the engine. If it's difficult to get the air box on, the vent tube on the carb is either and not in the recession of the air box or your intake boots are backwards. The rear one is slightly taller, if you are fighting to put the rear one on it it will pop off later. 

Fully attach your air filter and put your tank back on to connect the fuel line but don't bolt that on yet, you'll be taking it off again shortly. Start your bike and start checking for vacuum leaks. Lightly  and carefully spray whatever you want to use, carb cleaner, ether, electrical cleaner, ect, any of the listed should either drop or raise your rpms if there is a leak, find and fix any vacuum leaks and continue. Don't start blipping your throttle just let it idle, I think this caused my issue to reset, set your idle to 1000 rpms with the idle screw on the left side of the carbs and shut off the bike.

Remove your tank, air filter, and air box to access  the TPS plug again and use the torx security bit adjust your TPS sensor and plug again. When loosened, attach your leads with the alligator clips to the yellow and black wire connectors of the TPS cable . Set your multimeter to 2k or 4kŒ©, Your reading should be between .730Œ© and .760Œ© moving your throttle should change your resistance respectively. If you are getting an OL or 0 then you're on the wrong setting or you have a bad TPS sensor it should be good though. Make sure you on the right setting before you buy a new one. If your sensor is bottomed out then the little brass rings under the screws can be removed for a little more adjustment you shouldn't need to move the sensor very much to achieve your desired reading. Once you have the right setting down don't crank them super tight just snug, there isn't the brass ring there now to keep from breaking the plastic. Re-attach your TPS plug, and attach the hoses to to the vaccum lines to [Sync your carbs](https://youtu.be/ck_n04Dgesk) reinstall your air box and filter and tank. I recommended to get your bike up to operating temp before adjusting the sync screw, either let it idle up for a few minutes or take it for a short easy ride around the block. You may notice that the idle issue has not went away if you took it for a ride. Adjust the sync screw until both gauge needles are within range of each other. For some the idle issue is immediately resolved upon syncing the carbs, I kept lowering the idle as far as I could and giving a small throttle blip between adjustments until I stalled or lowering if for a block until it sounds like its almost dead when coming to a stop. Hit the kill switch and removed the key, raised the idle screw 1/3 of a turn and cranked the bike back over. 

The issue should be resolved and you can set your idle and air/fuel screws to your desired ranges. IF it is not I myself did the idle drop a few times before it seemed like it finally took. I tried my best from many hours of wrenching, reading, diagnosing and writing this and I do not have another resolution and I hope the best for you. If this fixed your issue leave me a comment and upvote ill be happy to respond to questions I might be able to help with.

can it cause damage if i leave em for another 10.000km like this (next inspection)

so would it be bad for the valves to do a 1500km trip right now? (mind you it's a long trip but i'm taking it very easy so it shouldn't strain the engine. also i did a full maintenance on the bike so everything is in great shape (new oil etc) expect the valve clearance)

"Bike is Yamaha vstar 1100 cc classic. 

This is the second time I have found water in my tank.

I parked at work with a very low tank (switched to reserve on the way just in case) with the intention of filling it up on the way home.  But... she stuttered and stammered when I applied the throttle.

I idled her some more and she was fine, apply throttle,  stall.  Restart fine, ease on throttle, stuttered, then off throttle and the idle was stuttering now.  I thought there may have been air in the lines so I let her run a bit and tried a touch of throttle, but nothing.

Then I realized the throttle channel is different from the idle and may have had water in it, whereas idle was the gas from the bottom of the tank.

So she's not starting at all now, because I believe there's water in the cylinders, and needs to be drained.  :(

Questions: am I right about this assessment, and how could water be getting into my tank?  It happened once before, and they found nothing.  The tank appears sound. I drive it year round, its never in storage.  Mostly local commutes.",Water in my gas tank (again).,1.0,motorcycle,yrs-bluebox,True

"What's going on guys . So I have a new 2021 ktm duke with only 1k miles on it. First round of maintenance is done. My first bike, had about 3 months but completely comfortable on it. I will acknowledge I lack experience riding in the rain. I would be doing this trip on my own. 

 So I've never done a trip past a few hours of riding. It's roughly 1200 miles, 20hours according to Google maps. (Is there a special navigational app for motorcycles?)  

How should I plan the trip? Just hop on Google maps and go? Not really ment to be a scenic type of trip just need to get to Florida.  

 Do you guys think it's wise to use a 400cc bike to do this trip? I can easily cruise 70s to 80s. 90-100 mph is pinning throttle, tucking and praying to the gods. 

 In reality how much time do you think it would take me to make it to Florida safely ?  It's a neutral riding position. How often should I take a break?

 I get about 120 miles per tank unfortunately, should I bring a gallon jug or something to refill  with gas along the way ? Should I try to plot gas stations every 100 miles? I usually get the gas warning at 30 miles . After that the mpg gage seems funky not sure if I can trust it . 

I'd probably bungie cord a duffle bag(clothes) to the tail. Thoughts?

I have steel toe boots and a full upper body pads I got off Amazon.  No riding pants .

I don't like riding with other people like at all. My friend that taught me how to ride already had over ten years of experience when he showed me how. He showed me on his and I got one like a week later. Anways I didn't like riding with him then because he was way more confident than me. So I thought that was normal. But anyways I've been riding for 3 years now on my third bike. I'm pretty confident but I just like cruising. I don't go fast I don't do wheelies I don't weave in and out of traffic. Anyways I've been working at dealerships for about 3 years and just started at Harley. They are super into riding together. Alot of the customers are too. Anways I just hate riding with people.

I seek help and wisdom  
i own a kawasaki KLE 500 year 2005

I has been a very reliable bike so far, but lately it got an issue....  
bike feels like it is misfiring when you accelerate from under 3k RPM, the bike is currently at the service shop but even the mechanic is running out of ideas...  


that is why i am asking for some help and ideas  
so far the bikes carburettor has been ultrasonically cleaned twice, it got compression test and is all OK, ignition coils looks to be fine because it produces spark, fuel flow is normal, this problem doesn't exist at idle speed or above 3500 RPM, only when accelerating.

"I'll try to keep this short, so let's just say my wife and I are having a bit of a mid-life crisis right now. We're mid-50s and neither of us have ridden a motor bike before. We're slowing down and want to see more of our own country (Canada) from the backroad point of view. We'd just be doing our own and neighbouring counties for the first year or two, then maybe moving provincial (Ontario) as we gain experience (and the full license). Eventually the goal would be some sort of cross Canada trip sometime in the next 5-6 years. A dual purpose motorcycle sounds like what we would we be looking for.

We would we both prefer to begin on something small and light, like the Yamaha XT250. We hear that it's been around forever and has excellent OEM support. There's a local dealer who is well regarded as well.

FYI. We'd be looking at buying new bikes, simply for the warranty and dealer support. In 3-5 years time we may move up a notch, but I cannot say for sure. If it's anything like my cars and trucks, once I get comfortable with it and it isn't giving me too many problems, I'll drive it until it's dead.

But the question I'm asking is NOT whether if I can handle the bike, it's whether ""can the bike handle me?"". Right now I'm just under 6 feet tall and hovering around 325lbs. My wife stands around 5 foot 9 and weighs in around 160-ish.

I just don't want to look like a circus bear driving a motorbike down the street while the bike whines and struggles beneath me.

If you can think of other bikes that might be a better option for us, that would be great and I will certainly look into it. There is a local dealer for Kawasaki who is also well regarded and I've been reading good things about the KLX300 too.

"For the past month or so, my 2017  Rebel 500 has had this odd behavior that I can't figure out how to fix.  The bike has otherwise been superb, running like a champ with no issues. The oddness is almost always between 10 mph and 20 mph (at the  top end of 1st gear and throughout 2nd gear but never in 3rd, 4th, 5th  or 6th).

If I'm accelerating,  it'll start to judder (shake) a few times. The engine sounds like the revs are going up and it feels like it's trying to shift itself into a  higher gear (it's not automatic). Once I get to about 20-22 mph it's normal again (but I've usually switched into 3rd gear by then anyway).  At higher speeds, there are no discernable problems.

"It's listed for $900 (dropped from $1300). It has 69k miles. I know this is considered high mileage, but is it too much? I don't drive too much (only put 8k miles on my car in two years).

""1994 BMW k1100 in rideable shape but not perfect cosmetically. Only put on around 200 miles this past year and everything functions including abs.

It has been knocked over in the driveway so one of the panniers is cracked and one mirror is cracked and in need of replacement. Panniers can also be removed easily. Clean title in hand.""

Is that a reasonable price? Should I ask less? What issues will I likely have to deal with? Is the bike worth getting? Would I be able to set it up with Bluetooth (assuming the speakers work)? Something as simple as hooking a Bluetooth receiver to the wiring harness instead of trying to find a stereo upgrade?

I'm looking to keep motorcycle for 5 to 7 years at least also I'm planning to abroad for my studies so I don't want to spend too much. My only problem with Duke 390 is it's high compression ratio and heating issues as mentioned in online forums. I think 373cc is too huge for a single idk(it doesn't feel right for me).

"Recently purchased my first bike 2 weeks ago.  I got a 95 Yamaha Virago.  I like the look and style of the bike but getting it to run reliably has been an issue so far.  

Battery wouldn't stay charged so I replaced the rectifier.  Now trying to test it yesterday and it ran for about 10 minutes before it started idling low and quit.  It didn't want to restart until I realized that the petcock was in Prim and changed that.  Then I took the air filer off and sprayed starter fluid into the intake.  Started right up after that and has started twice with no issues since then.

I read that leaving the bike in Prim can lead to gas getting into the oil so I checked and the oil cap smells strong with gas.  Planning on changing it soon especially since this led me into checking the oil window only to see nothing.  Thinking it could possibly be new oil and hard to see but taking no chances I'm going to drain and change whatever is in there.

This leads me to my question that I'm sure a few will debate on.  What type/brand of oil is recommended for a motorcycle?  If weather temps is a consideration I live in Indiana so we see a good mix of all seasons.",First bike purchased,1.0,motorcycle,jwiley78,True

"Okay, so reading this back this is hardcore coming across as a shit post on my bud, it's really not... I'm just trying to get into the mindset of someone like him and want to understand why he thinks the way he does.  


I have a bud who makes 0 sense to me sometimes. Buys a motorcycle (CBR600RR) and never rides it more than ""20 minutes"" at a time, never wants to ride with other people, but will post pictures of it all the time like he is some BA biker boy... He has been riding the last... 3 years I believe? I would put money that he has not ridden over 2k miles on motorcycles in those 3 years and has had 4 bikes total in that time. He has owned a 96 Suzuki GS600E, a 07 Kawasaki Versys 650, a 97 Suzuki Katana 650, and now his latest horse is a 04 CBR600RR. He says he does not like to go on ""long trips"" on bikes but likes to ""rip down the road"". He is also the type of guy who will buy an older bike, do no CRITICAL maintenance on it besides oil/filter before he starts messing with the bike cosmetically, does not check bearings, brake fluid, brake lines, tire health, chain/sprocket wear, ect.. He actually snapped 3 of the manifold head bolts on the 97 Suzuki Katana (used no penetrating fluid, no heat, just trying to dry dog them off without asking anyone for opinions on the STOCK header) because he wanted to remove the exhaust due to not liking ""dual mufflers"" on motorcycles, so he totaled that bike by snapping 3 head bolts in it, then braking an extractor in one, THEN drilled 2 of the holes crooked when trying to simply drill out the snapped bolts. He sold that bike at a 800ish dollar loss (paid a grand before taxes/title/registration) after you factor in the new SS exhaust he bough (header back), fairing kit from china that didnt fit that he sold for 120 less than he paid for it, and other misc crap.  


Most recently I had this conversation with him on Facebook:  


 Him: Autozone has gold motorcycle wheel paint

Me: The only thing that is going to suck about doing the rims on your bike is you will need to go somewhere after and get them rebalanced unless you were not gonna take off the wheel weights

Him: Psh I'll just leave the weights on, Idc about that

Me: You won't be able to clean the area under the wheel weight if you don't take them off, then whenever you get them balanced you will have a rectangle spot that is the old color.

Him: Also we could just put painters tape over the wheel weight. Oh. Well I doubt I'll have the change the tires for a few years, Atleast the front

Me: A few years? Lol. I go through tires on my bikes in like a year in a half in longest, sometimes sooner. The only people who don't change their tires often are people who don't ride.

Him: Well I don't really ride that often. If I ever do its usually like 20 min drive

Me: Then what was the point of getting a bike my dude, To pick up chicks?

Him: Just because I don't like to ride long distances doesn't mean I don't enjoy driving it, That's your opinion

Me: It's not about long distances, you just said you don't ride often. And then said you only put about 20 minutes on at a time at the most. You're putting on like..... maybe 600 miles each summer?

Him: Yeah I usually don't have anywhere I want to go, And I don't like to drive 2+ hours, at most maybe a hour 1 way

Me: It's not about the destination with a motorcycle, its about getting out in nature, enjoying the open road, having fun. You look at it in such a narrow mindset

Him: That's your opinion, You could do the same with a car with the window down

Me: That's not an opinion lol...... Ask any motorcyclist who is actually a motorcyclist and they will tell you the same thing, if you wanted something with two wheels that gets good gas milage that you can take ""20 minutes"" you should of gotten a scooter dude.

Him: Doesn't make it a fact if you specifically like to have a motorcycle for that reason

Me: Whatever man, just think you could of spent your money on something else that could of preoccupied your time better than the bike then.

Him: I like to drive my bike with no destination sometimes just not a long distancr, Its just a toy I like to rip on every now and then. I don't drive it as a cruiser

&amp;#x200B;

I just took a 2004 CB599F from GA, to FL, then up to PA last summer, and that is a ""sporty"" bike just like his, maybe not as super aggressive in body posture but still not a ""cruiser"" as he wants to put it, I put tons of miles on, at least around a minimum of 4k a year. I just don't understand how people can buy a bike and then proceed to never ride it, it blows my mind. I guess that is why there are so many bikes that are 1999 and older with less than 15-20 thousand miles on them with 4+ owners, I don't think I'll ever understand it...","What is motorcycling to you guys?

"I‚Äôve only had this bike for a few weeks now, but I‚Äôve already had 3 falls. At first I thought maybe it was me being stupid and inexperienced, but when I look at the situations, it‚Äôs the other people who caused it.

First incident, I was pulling through into a parking lot space. There was a person parked next to that spot. Person did not look, and cut *through* (his car went over a third into the space!) my parking spot while turning and cut me off. Swerved away from the car and hit the brakes, but I was unable to keep balance in doing so and fell. 

Second incident was probably the weirdest. I was at a stop sign, and car was coming in from a turn. Other driver had no stop sign, but for some reason stopped in the middle of the road for a solid 10 seconds. I had absolutely no idea why they stopped there for so long, so I assumed they were giving me right of way for whatever reason. Nope. As soon as I started going, the other driver decided to start going again and cut me off. Same thing happened, only I ended up on the road this time. THE DRIVER MOST DEFINITELY SAW ME FALL, BUT CONTINUED TO DRIVE OFF ANYWAY. 

Today‚Äôs incident really shook me up, because I did not think PEDESTRIANS of all people would be this stupid, and unlike the other incidents, miraculously did not leave any damage to me or my bike. I was leaving a parking lot and 2 girls were standing on the edge of the grass, repeatedly hesitating on attempting to walk past me. I drove the OPPOSITE direction of these girls to further distance myself from them, and then one of them decided it would be a good idea to try to out-run my motorcycle and dash past it exactly like a deer would. Let‚Äôs just say if I didn‚Äôt slam the brakes, she probably would‚Äôve ended up like a deer trying that due to her small size. I ended up with a pretty bent up brake lever, and my crotch got pressed into the seat pretty hard. Thank god replacements levers are incredibly cheap.

Every time I hopped on the bike after that  incident today, my heart POUNDED in anxiety. My lack of experience and the fact that people are *this* stupid AND are behind 2000 lb fast moving boxes of metal scares me so bad. I don‚Äôt know what to do, because even when I take precaution, people still manage to out-stupid my precautions (hence the 3rd incident). I feel like THIS level of stupidity is mostly contained in my town, as I never fell or ran into any issue with other drivers/pedestrians even 20+ miles from home.

"It was around 12:30AM when I heard that familiar sound, my motorcycle starting. I don't have any other form of transportation, no car, just a 2005 black honda VT750 Shadow Spirit. And I love that bike. I loved it so much, I road one when I was 18, and when I turned 25 I bought one for myself as a daily driver. It's my jam.

And now its gone..

I woke up to the familiar sound of my bike starting. I look out my window and I can see 4-5 guys standing around my bike. I park where I can see it from my apartment window. I'm on the 3rd floor, so it's easy to see.

Which, now that I think about it, just adds fuel to the fire.. Not only did I wake up to the sound of my bike, but I had the pleasure of identifying what was happening as I fumble for my pants, keys, and phone.

Why didn't I take photos of them? Because I'm a fucking moron. I was too busy trying to convince myself I didn't park in that -exact- spot, that this wasn't happening to me.

But it was. I got outside and the bike was gone. Those people were gone.

And now here I am, alone, no motorcycle. The cops say there is hope because I put a call in so quickly and have my license plate memorized.

They both run and start just fine except for one thing. Once I'm driving, particularly when the bike is cold, when I let off the throttle and pull in the clutch the rpms will just go down to zero and the bike will die. It will start up just fine right after but I have to constantly give it gas and let it down slowly or else it will die. It's pretty annoying.

I bought both of these bikes this way and haven't done anything to them to cause this. I didn't really care with the 2006 b/c it was cheap and I didn't want to put time and money into it but the 2011 wasn't suppose to have any issues so I'm a bit pissed at the guy who sold it but that's on me. 

Anyway, I found a few posts with people with similar issues but no one seems to have updated it with what has fixed the issue. One post seemed to indicate it was a spark-plug issue which I am going to be replacing soon along with cleaning the air filter. This doesn't seem to be a common issue so I am confused how I could get two bikes like this.

"Just over 2 years ago I made a mistake. I didn't realise it was a mistake until about 3 weeks ago but once it was done there was no going back. 

What on earth could this horrible mistake be? I decided to save for my CBT licence. I'm 36 now and I've wanted to ride motorcycles since I was a kid. Its the one dream that leaves me with that childhood type of need for something when it just overtakes every part of you. Unfortunately by the time you are old enough that the dream is in your own hands... other responsibilities seem to endlessly pile up pushing that dream further and further away until it seems unreachable. Whether it be bills, children, car repairs or just getting you and your family by... I've realised the impossible task of selfishly putting myself first to get a bike, was never going to happen. 

With that in mind and some level of acceptance and discussion with my fianc√©e, we agreed a plan. In early 2019 we made a ""CBT pot"". We would put ¬£1 in that pot every week and in around 2 years I would have enough money (guilt free) to book my training and finally get on a bike. Half way through when the Pandemic hit this obviously caused problems. I won't bore you with a sob story but my daughter has respiratory problems so the pandemic caused a lot of problems for us. My other half later ended up not working and as such I decided my CBT pot needs to be forgotten. She insisted we continue and will make it work somehow, so we stuck to it. 

Fast forward two years of saving and I had enough to book my training. I was actually still a little short but I am a postman working for royal mail and I have some generous customers on a particular street I deliver to daily. They would always talk to me and were interested in my little adventure. They so kindly got together a little fund on the street and donated ¬£36 to my pot as a thank you for my work during the pandemic. I will be forever grateful. It amazes me how selfless and generous some people can be. 

So I went ahead and booked. After what seemed like a long wait, on the 26th May 2021 at 8:30am it was CBT time :) 

Apart from the birth of my two children (4 and almost 3 year old) I honestly don't remember a day I enjoyed more than being on that bike. Obviously I knew I wanted to ride before... but it couldnt have prepared me for how amazing a feeling it turned out to be. The excitement, the freedom, the thrill of learning something new and realising the intricacies of bike riding and how much more there was to learn was just so overpowering to me. 

However the part that was most surprising to me was the meditative feeling it gave after this terrible year. I've never practiced meditation or anything like that... however, I think now that riding a motorcycle gives that kind of feeling. The fact that you are forced to think in the moment and of nothing else. All the day to day troubles or worries dissappear for that time you are riding. Your brain and senses lock in and you are forced to put every part of your mind and body into that task and your life could depend on that. The feeling I got from that was like no other i've ever experienced and I genuinely believe that having that as a regular experience would make me a better and more balanced person in every aspect of my regular life as well. Also the realisation that having a bike gives you the gift of time. A price can't be put on extra time in the morning or evening with my family... the reality of the time wasted sitting in traffic has never become more apparent to me than how it feels now, as I watch motorcycles glide past i get filled with a mix of jealousy and desperation to be a member of their club. 

I also feel that it's made me a better road user in general. As a driver for work or even as a pedestrian. I look at things differently now. When I drive I imagine I'm on a motorcycle and try to think like one (never noticed until now how many drains and hazards there are on our roads) 

I had got the bike bug... and got it bad. 

About 30 minutes after the CBT had ended and I had made calls to my closest friends and family to tell them about my wonderful day, the sad reality hit me, that it was over. Over in the most final of ways. I realised then that I might have made a terrible mistake and I'm still unsure as to whether it was right now as I write this email. 

I guess what I'm saying is I could never have predicted what my life would be like AFTER that day. All the years growing up as a kid seeing bikes, my adult life believing I'd soon have one of them. Then after all else failed i'd spent the last 2 years putting ¬£1 a week into that jar and counting down the moment that I would gear up, be presented with my bike for the day and take that first step over the seat. I'd spent night and day dreaming about what it would feel like and not a thought was given to how I would deal with this feeling afterwards. 

If I'm honest it's really affected me in a really negative way. My mood is extremely low, my friends and family have noticed a change in me. My family had sacrificed to help build up that pot for me and that's the most we could do.
The realisation that even if we continue to do that, the CBT runs out in 2 years. It's a pretty demoralising feeling knowing that I work as hard as I can and the best possible end result as my reward is a CBT day every 2 years. 

I don't even want to tell anyone why I've been so down. To my friends I'm ashamed that as a grown man I can't afford a small bike that to many, is not a significant cost. To my family I don't want to admit the reason because I don't want them to feel bad or like they should sacrifice anything more for me. So I quietly try to deal with this depressing new outlook but it's hard. I know this seems ridiculous and over dramatic, but to me it's very real.

"I haven't tried riding a sportbike yet, (I'm a road cyclist) and people on youtube is telling that touring on a sportbike is really tiring because of the leaning forward position.

What factors make riding a sportbike ""painful in the wrists and back"" but not on a road bike? Is it because of higher speeds? The heavy helmet? Or the wind?

Been having a problem with a couple helmets. Like many of us, I started with the Scorpion EXO R420 because it's cheap, looks nice, and has great safety ratings. Hoping some of you can chime in on this.

As you can see from the pics, the tabs have just given up keeping the plastic frame inside the helmet.

Now, this is actually the replacement helmet for my last helmet that had the exact same issue.

Not dropped, no removal of pads (nor even attempted), no extraneous use. In fact, my last helmet was worn only once (during my MSF course), and this one was only worn maybe 5 times before the end of last season (got a new lid over the winter).

I had hoped to keep this helmet for pillions, but it sags right in the sightline and is not exactly confidence inspiring. They were both purchased/replaced from the same shop last year, so I would presume they're from the same production batch.

Sadly, I'm in Canada, so Scorpion doesn't really care about the issue and just refers me to wherever I got it from.

"In 2017 I sought out my first ""real"" motorcycle, one I felt confident enough to not drop or crash with. I had been riding for about 2 years and started on a 600cc. I found a 2003 GSXR-1000 in amazing condition with a little only 5,000 miles.

I bought the bike, got a new, clean title from the NJ DMV, and registered the bike. I rode it for probably 200 miles before the season ended. 

I moved to VA later that year and have been here since. After about 2 years I decided it was time to get back on the bike (and my new job had a longer commute and I wanted to save on gas). A friend brought the bike down on a trailer for me. It sat outside my apartment for about 2 months and one day I found that someone had attempted to steal it by breaking off my ignition in half with a screwdriver. Finding it wasn't hard to replace, I bought a new ignition and triple tree, and attempted to put it in myself. Fitment wasn't right on the triple tree, so I put it off and the bike sat for another 1 years, out of pure laziness.

Last month, I finally called a mechanic and told him the scenario. After a week, and $2,500 later, I had my bike back, up and running. I am excited to get back on it. She rides great!

I make an appointment to go the the DMV to get it registered, and have to wait a month (thanks, COVID). I walk into the DMV today, hand them the title, and after a few minutes, the man behind the counter asks me if my motorcycle was ever salvaged. I look at him puzzled and answer ""no, I have a clean title and don't know about this"". After a few minutes he tells me he can't give me a VA title because the national VIN registry says my motorcycle is salvaged. 

I am really confused now. I call the salvage title line and ask how this can be. They tell me if its registered as such, it needs to be treated as a salvage. Fine...I just want to ride the damn bike. Just give me the salvaged title. Turns out you need salvaged paperwork, and I have no way of getting any of this considering this is the first time I'm hearing about it. VA is now telling me that I cannot title or register my ""Salvaged"" motorcycle with the paperwork (that is non-existent). I don't have a way to contact the seller, and not sure that would help me anyway.

Has anyone ever experienced something like this? The mechanic I brought it to said he didn't see anything that would indicate it was heavily damaged. VIN matches on title. I'm just lost for words. So much money down the drain and I have no clear answer on how I can get this thing registered.

Any advise or ideas on how I can get on my bike back again would be great. I just want some damn plates on this thing so I can get going again. I'm even open to selling it at this point, but obviously I'm not going to dump this on someone else (even though I had no issue getting it registered in NJ originally).",My clean GSXR turned salvage,1.0,motorcycle,TheVeJewtarian,True

"First and foremost I'm gunna say it before anyone else does: ""I'm full of shit and I have no idea what I'm talking about"".  Now that we got that outta the way, here's my two cents, although it is probably worth less than that.

Before you buy your bike, before you have a budget on your bike, before you even get on a bike, buy your gear first.  What ever you consider gear, buy it first.  Boots are always better than shoes, mostly so when your bike fall down and go boom, it won't sprain ankle, or at least will keep said ankle in a compression long enough to not swell up till you take the boot off.

Make sure you can touch the ground when you are seated on the bike and in the same vein, make sure you're not kissing your knees when you are sitting on it.

Summer hot, Winter cold, per country, state, city, town...area code.  Dress per your occasion, not what someone else does.

Learn to ride slow. Learn to turn slow.  Learn how to CA. roll.  Learn how to stop, then go.  Learn how to slam on the brakes, downshift dramatically fast (as in your light just turned red and you are going 45mph.).  Learn how to do a U-turn from a stop.

YouTube videos are great, but they don't teach you how to ride a bike.  You're just gunna have to ride.  You're gunna drop your bike, your gunna stall your bike.  You're gunna have all the answers to all the questions till you don't.

Read your manual.

Don't finance your first bike, also your first bike not be the right bike, hence the first part of the sentence.

Even after you buy your bike, buy your gear, learn how to ride, take an MSF course and watch a thousand hours of YouTube videos, A: you might decide riding isn't for you; B: realize that that isn't a substitute for actually riding and/or C: anything else.  You riding is your ride.  Whether it is too hot, too cold, too windy; the roads are too wet; it's too early, too dark, what ever the reason is.  Ride, don't ride; take pictures of it, or just ride it to the bar and then ride it home (completely sober of course); it's your ride, you do you.",New Riders - my two cents - probably worth less,1.0,motorcycle,SkruffyJew,True

So, if you guys have been following or care, I was riding a clapped out drz400s with a knee disarticulation (I have a kneecap but no bendable knee and nothing below it). I currently use an ottobock 3r60 prosthetic, which is a 4-bar style bending knee that locks when extended and weight is applied. It's super basic, basically has no resistance just free bends unless fully extended and you put weight on it, then its locked into place.

Riding the Drz was going great at times, and pretty fucking awful at other times. The awful stuff was mainly how the bike was falling apart. The front brake has no feedback, just goes from 0-100 real fast, the front wheel bearing is fucked so the wheel will on occasion start to wander, and the throttle has to be gently blipped when the clutch is in or itll stall. And I had keep all of this in mind when stopping, AND stop on the left every single time, without exceptions.

I often lamented that I traded my r6 for this bike, because I don't really ""get"" supermotos that much (I do a little bit more now, its so fucking flickable in tight corners that even slow speeds feel more fun because of how confidence inspiring it is), and my r6, despite the weight and seating position, was a cleaner bike with everything working 100%. I often wondered if the lightness and wide steering radius of the DRZ didn't make up for its quirks, and if the r6 would've been better because of how everything on it just ""worked""

Let me just say, after buying my r6 back, I definitely made the right choice sticking with the drz.

When my unemployment FINALLY hit (fuck phil murphy), first thing I did was buy it before the new owner (a friend of mine) sold it to some wannabe stuntrider. He put new fairings on it (no longer the sunny D orange), wrapped the gas tank to match, and put a crg clutch, braided brake lines, vortex rearsets, and a 500 dollar brembo master cylinder on the bike. So, basically it was my bike, but not really ""my bike"" anymore.

First thing I notice when I get on it is wow, its fucking aggressive. I forgot how aggressive these things are. Second thing is that my prosthetic is HIGH on the fucking peg. Obviously the pegs were set to the highest position possible, but I mean, fuggit right? I thought this would make it a little easier to place my prosthetic on the peg in a hurry (just bend it all the way back to my thigh and put it down, don't worry about finding the peg with the ""foot"") but in truth, it didn't really do much. Now, the one thing my friend told me as I left his driveway (that I wish I heeded sooner) was ""speed is your friend"". Crawling down his driveway under just first gear idle power, I was fuckin more scared than I've ever been on a bike in years. Part of it was the downhill of his street combined with a DOWNHILL AS FUCK right turn (my other friend was riding back with me and told me he would try to block off any cars coming if necessary, but luckily there were none)

In truth, what made it so scary was the complete unknown factor of the bike, coupled with the fact that this no longer felt like a toy (like the drz). This was a heavy, 118 horsepower sportbike, and it was NOTHING like my drz. It wasn't even anything like the r3s I had ridden since my accident (which by the way, felt fucking amazing, almost easier to ride than the drz to be honest). My heart was POUNDING when I came to my first stop, I let it go to the left and felt the sheer weight of the bike on my incredibly weak left leg, and I was fuckin scared shitless, doing breathing techniques to stay in control.

As time went on I realized a few things:

Having a good front brake means I didn't need to be sweating when I pulled it in, as I could 2 finger it EXTREMELY progressively (kinda like my ex)

Speed IS my friend. I don't need to launch it, but I need to start moving immediately from a stop, none of that wobbley pussyfootin shit

Because my front brake was progressive, I didn't have to do the drz style stop (pull it till it barely engages, then a little more till it hard brakes and then put my foot out as I let the bike fall to the left), but instead I could drag my foot and progresssiveeely slow down to a halt.

When my right leg slipped off the peg, it was not at all easy to put it back on while riding. I couldn't reach it with my left arm like I would with the drz, so I had to clutch in, weight the bar with my left arm (because I only have one foot on the bike) and grab the prosthetic leg and finagle it on the peg.

Once I sat all the way back in my seat, ALL of this stuff became easier.

I actually realized fairly soon that putting both legs out with the r6 made it SUPER easy to come to a stop. To put weight on the right leg (prosthetic), I either keep it bent but constantly press down on it to counteract the forces trying to make it bend, or I extend it out at an angle like a kickstand would be. On the drz I rarely bother to put both legs out, as it doesn't make a huge difference, but with the r6 it really did.

Walking it, while not easy, was not super super difficult, and while a hill might be my undoing, I am also super super fucking weak right now and I can only get stronger. Putting the kickstand up and down was really hard at first, then I remembered that this isn't the drz and I can do it with my hand (but I'm still going to try and get used to using my foot for practice). Same with putting it in neutral, but I realized that this isn't the drz and it will start in gear.

Once we stopped at round valley, I took a breather, and put music on, the rest of the ride was a blast. I don't think I'll be ripping it anytime soon, but holy fuck is it a fun bike to ride. Except...

THE FUCKING BACK PAIN. The back pain is UNREAL. The drz I had backpain with after 40 minutes, and after riding it for a while I can stave off back pain until I've been on it for near 2 hours (and honestly just utilizing really good posture helps), but the r6 gave me backpain FUCKING IMMEDIATELY. Feels like screws turning in my neck and shoulderblade and spine. I probably need to seriously work out my core, but a part of it might be due to the number of surgeries I had on my back (had some spinal fusions? Used em as an excuse to add an extra inch to my height when renewing my license)

But yeah, that's how it's going! Any tips or insight would be appreciated, I share this stuff mainly to organize my thoughts and keep a record of how things are going, but I hope that some of you see this and know that anything is possible with determination and willpower. Nothing gives you confidence to ride with one leg than your first bike post-accident being a clapper that wobbles and stalls every fucking chance it gets, with a vague and spiteful front brake that wants you to lock it up :)",Riding with one leg,0.86,motorcycle,maanu123,True

"I bought a used cb300f a few months ago, it ended up needing a new crankshaft (among other things) I thought it was my lucky day, there was a open recall on the crankshaft with the fix being Honda replacing the crank. I called Honda to find an authorized dealer but they claimed the recall did not affect my bike (said it did not effect every year) even though the vin had multiple recalls attached and a bulletin Honda put out saying all cb300‚Äôs needed this repair. I found a local dealer that would replace it and they even said they knew that Honda refuses to fix these. The dealership was full for the next 3 months so I just bought the parts myself and fixed it. Out of curiosity one day I called Honda again to question why the dealer said there was a recall but they didn‚Äôt. They claimed that there was a recall on my bike but it was already fixed before it left the factory. Suspicious because my bike was sold in early 2015 and the sources I have seen said the recall happened in 2016. 

I ended up buying about 1500 in parts but ended up not using a large amount of them, Honda says they allow returns and to call or email them to return unused parts however they will not return my emails or calls after weeks.

MONSTER 620 2004 APTC CLUTCH

my clutch is slipping i have the 25KW version running at full power. IT ONLY SLIPS WHEN THE OIL IS NICE AND WARM, WHEN IT'S COLD IT DOESN'T. i'm thinking perhaps the springs are wornout/too weak, the clutch slips at certain gears (it's not really bad, but a bit annoying)

i heard 25kw models mount the springs from the monster 400 which are softer, also the clutch only engages when the clutch lever is pretty much all the way out.

the springs fix apparently only works for non APTC clutches. so i have a APTC clutch, is it possible that the springs are worn out or is it likely the clutch plates?

"Hi all  
Lately, my commute has been all wet...literally...and I've found that my 15 year old, once-waterproof gloves...aren't...anymore.  They were Joe Rocket's, had a Hypora liner, and they were really quite good, for quite a long time.  


I'm in the market for new gloves, though, for my commute, and I'm curious to know who's got what, and what their appeal is, before I pull the trigger on a new pair.  


\*Note...I'm not really interested in spending $300 USD for a pair of Held's.  They're great gloves, no doubt, but I'm on a bit of a budget, as raising (and gearing up) kids is expensive, ya know?

"Hello! I'm 21, and live in Sonoma County, California. My dad gave me his 2007 Honda Civic Hybrid when I was 19. I've never driven a motorcycle. I've ridden behind a boy scout leader, but that's about it. I want a motorcycle, but I don't want two vehicles. Would it be a bad idea to sell my Civic and pick up a Suzuki GSX or something like that?

  
I mostly use my Civic to drive places with my laptop and a school bag. I also sometimes need to do errands like picking up a couple groceries from the store for my mom.

&amp;#x200B;

I've broken down the decision into pros and cons:  
Pros:

* I'll be honest. I mostly want a bike because it looks cool.
* I can split lanes on the highway.
* Gas mileage is a plus in California.
* Lower insurance rates.
* If I really need a car, I probably borrow a car from my parents or just Uber.
* Easy parking.

Cons:

* I'm aware that motorcycles have around a 1/1000 fatality rate. I don't drink or smoke, and I'm not interested in wheelies and driving dangerously, so I'm fine with the risk.
* I could get injured and ruin my life.
* Low cargo capacity.
* It does rain during the winter, and it looks like some riders don't ride during the rain. Perhaps a bad idea?
* More frequent maintenance, although I like maintaining my car already.

Has anyone here sold their car to buy a motorcycle, and then regretted it? If so, why? Is there some sort of pouch thing I can strap to the back of a sport bike to carry groceries home? 

I have prescription glasses that I need in order to drive. Does that matter? 

I'm open to any other advice.

does the 6 gear 2003 620 mount a APTC clutch?

my clutch is slipping i have the 25KW version running at full power. i'm thinking perhaps the springs are wornout/too weak, the clutch slips at certain gears (it's not really bad, but a bit annoying)

i heard 25kw models mount the springs from the monster 400 which are softer, also the clutch only engages when the clutch lever is pretty much all the way out.

how can tell if my monster has a APTC clutch or not? do all 6 gear models have a APTC clutch?

"I'm not looking to start anything, nor am I looking to open a hornet's nest; I'm just curious as to why.  Let me explain (and please read all).

I grew up with organizations in my life that were based on the color of your clothes and the color of your skin.  Also where I lived and the people I chose to hang out with, I saw a lot of those organizations that used motorcycles for their mode of transportation.

You were able to discern who was who and what was what based on the color of your clothes, and then the color of your skin, and of course there were those that wore patches in the form of top rocker, bottom rocker, and middle, and those were the people that rode motorcycles.

I respected everyone and got along with everyone, I also became a member of a non-motorcycle group and earned my certain articles of clothing.  To some, actually, to most, they were just suspenders, but to me, I earned them, *hard.*  So when I see people pretending to be a part of organizations because they want to be cool or are just trying to get a rise out of someone, I honestly don't understand.  Why be something that you are not, or why try to provoke people?  

For instance the Lone Wolf patch, or rider club patches, something or just the position of three patches; why do it?

Maybe I'm just too realistic I don't get it.  I guess it is the same kinda people that pretend to have been in the military (as a Vet, that really pisses me off, but that's a ~~rant~~ conversation for another time).",Three-piece patch opinion,1.0,motorcycle,SkruffyJew,True

"Quick question from a new rider.

What I usually ride in is a RST jacket, carpenter/lumberjack style pants with reinformcments and regular capped work boots.

Today I was working on my bike (messing with the suspension and tire pressure) and just hopped on in my casual wear which consisted of a hoodie and sweatpants with running shoes.

By God, it's so much more comfortable than ATGATT.
No belt buckle to gnaw at my stomach, no thick pants to chafe my thighs and ass.

But I'm no squid, it was just a ride around the block and I felt naked and vulnerable the entire time.

Buuut, the experience was pleasant enough that I immediately went online and found that a few shops around my location have hoodies with protectors and ""abrasion resistant"" materials.

Does anyone have experience with ""casual gear""?

Also, I couldn't find any sort of ""riding sweatpants"", does that even exist?

"Hi all,

I've come to a point in my life that I want to do a cross country motorcycle ride. It sounds crazy(for me) but I wanted to get some inputs on many different angles. And if anyone wants to tag along I'm more than happy to welcome you on this journey. 

About my riding history:
I have about 2k miles on my 2020 honda rebel 500. Yes I'm new but I am very confident on the road with this bike. I'm on my mid 30s with clean driving record so I think that counts for something in terms of whether how safe I am on the road... My MSF course test was on a rainy day and that's been the only experience I have in terms of riding on the rain. I may have to standby on days when it rains. Anyway, my current location is Maryland and my goal is to get to CA. I have families in Arkansas, Texas and California but this will be an interesting adventure. 

What I think I'll need:
-Saddle bags
-GoPro? So expensive though... What do u guys think? 
-a day or two or spare clothes? (or just one?)
-hard copy of a map
-offline map (app)
-new oil change before leaving the state

What I'll bring:
-water
-charger bank
-EZ Pass
-tooth brush, deodorant, sun glasses, 
-some cash
-disk lock (maybe?) 
-few snacks

Question:
I'm not sure about where I want to sleep at night. Maybe one of those thing where you can crash on someone's couch? Or AirBnB? I want it to be at a low cost as possible. I don't want to load the bike like crazy but if it makes sense to camp then I may have to invest or buy used tent. Anyone who have done this what did you guys/gals do? 

Is there a website/forums where people share ideas, routes, tips, dos and don'ts etc? 

What did you do after you reached from point A to point B? Did you ship your bike back and flew back home or did you ride back home?

I'm currently working on a project in Design and Tech for my A Level and I've been wanting to get a bike for a while and have been watching copious amounts of biking videos and the lot and I've found that, I'm not sure if it's loads but it's definitely a few, that like a loud exhaust, want have or had one, but wished that sometimes it wasn't so loud, I know someone who wheeled their bike out of their street in the morning because of how loud it was so there's definitely audience enough to pursue this. 

I'm also aware of laws that prohibit exhausts over a certain decibel and I'm also aware that some people don't follow these laws, so for those who have a loud exhaust but wish they could sometimes just shut it up until you get out of a street or town or past the police or whatever, please could you answer this pole, it'd be a massive help!

Is it possible to use it to show proof that I passed a licensing course and get my endorsement added to my DL?

"17y/o here. Been riding for half a year. I posted earlier a picture of the broken bike asking if it was fixable.

I was driving to fort hays Kansas from Kansas City yesterday at 12:30 halfway to Lawrence the person in front of my slammed their brakes and I rammed into them 75mph.

When I hit them I kept slowing down so it was liked I bounced off of them. So I‚Äôm that moment I thought about swerving To the right, and that‚Äôs what I did. I don‚Äôt remember much but the car behind me said after I swerved, I flew 15 feet forward. Which was pretty funny because I am the state champion at pole vault in Kansas so I made the joke that I can vault 15 ft in the air with a pole and long 15 ft with a motorcycle.

When I was in the ground I immediately got up and thought that I need to check if I can walk. Make sure no injuries for track.
Everyone around me was checking up on me to make sure i wasn‚Äôt about to die but I felt fine. I noticed I had some huge road rashes on my right hand.

They called the ambulance and they took me to a hospital in Overland Park. They found no internal damage except for a broken pelvis. But We found out yesterday that I‚Äôve had a broken pelvis for multiple months now. So I don‚Äôt feel any pain in the pelvis. 

The only injuries I got are some really bad road rashes. Which is kind of insane because I should be dead right now. 

I was wearing a full face helmet. No jacket or pants. Which I regret, I should‚Äôve wore the jacket and pants. It looks like I‚Äôll be good to start training once the rashes heal.

"Kawasaki Ninja 300 is a sports bikes available at a starting price of Rs. 3,18,000 in India. It is available in only 1 variant and 3 colours. The Ninja 300 is powered by 296cc BS6 engine which develops a power of 38.88 bhp and a torque of 26.1 Nm. With both front and rear disc brakes, Kawasaki Ninja 300 comes up with anti-locking braking system. This Ninja 300 bike weighs 179 kg and has a fuel tank capacity of 17 liters.

The Kawasaki Ninja 300 BS6 has been launched in India at a price premium over the BS4 model. Yet, the Ninja 300 remains the most affordable Kawasaki motorcycle in the Indian market.

The company‚Äôs highest-selling model has received mechanical upgrades to comply with the newest emission norms. Despite complying with the newer, more stringent emission norms, Kawasaki has retained the powered output numbers from the BS4 model. The BS6-compliant, 296cc, parallel twin-cylinder, liquid-cooled motor on the Ninja 300 makes 38.8bhp at 11,000rpm and 26.1Nm of peak torque at 10,000rpm. The engine is linked to a six-speed gearbox that benefits from a slipper and an assist clutch function.

The overall design remains similar to the BS4 model, although Kawasaki has updated the colour palette and the graphics to the Ninja 300 BS6. The motorcycle will be sold in three colour options ‚Äì Lime Green with KRT graphics, Candy Lime Green, and Ebony. The latter two feature honey-comb graphics on the fairing. The styling cues retain a twin-pod headlight, a semi-digital instrument cluster, and split-style seats.

The frame and the cycle parts, too, remain similar to the BS4 model. Thus, the Kawasaki Ninja 300 BS6 continues to use a diamond frame. The suspension setup includes 37mm telescopic front forks and a preload-adjustable rear mono-shock.The anchoring duties are performed by a 290mm disc at the front and a 220mm single rotor at the back while the safety net includes dual-channel ABS.

While the Kawasaki Ninja 300 doesn‚Äôt have a direct rival, it faces some competition from the likes of TVS Apache RR310 and the KTM RC390.

"I am a 15 year old (soon 16) and I have been looking into doing a motorcycle license for the last 2 months (A1 : 125 cc, max 11k and max 0.1 kw/kg).

I am mainly interested to get from A to B since I have to be 18 for a car license (B), I can do the license at 17 already (BF17) but that requires having someone who has had their car license and is 25. I recently moved to a quite rural region, so public transit is near useless and having my parents drive me everywhere ain't great either. 

I have ridden motorcycles once so far. It was on a private property of a friend. Started out on a 1970s 80 cc suzuki 2 stroke and got the hang of it in about 15-30 min. After that I hopped on a yamaha tt-r 230 and about 30 mins later I was ripping it around the property. I had an absolute blast riding both bikes but I have some doubts if the same will be true on road.

I am not a fearful person very far from it, I have been riding mountain bikes for 8 years, and ride quite big stuff (5m height drops, 20 m length jumps, rockslabs etc.) Nonetheless the accident statistics make me wonder also because quite a bit of the risk appears not to be in my power. 

Ideally I would talk to someone who has ridden for some time. I have talked to my host-dad (I am currently on my year abroad) since he played a part in sparking the idea but I don't really feel comfortable taking safety advice from him because he has done stuff like driving a 450 cc 3 wheeler slightly drunk without a helmet and getting rolled over by it in a curve. 

What do you guys think about ABS? Is it a must have on a 125 cc?

So should I do my motorcycle license? How high is the risk? I don't want to make a decision I will regret later.

"Motorcyclists constantly complain about how drivers are always trying to kill them but I always see them trying to kill themselves by Extreme speeding, Weaving traffic, Blocking intersections, Tailgating, etc.

I have a couple fast cars a new one (2021) and an old one (2000). I also have super fucking slow ones (1984 and 1986). I apply the same rules to both. When I want to drive fast I go to a fucking track. When I want to drive fast on the road I'm in the middle of fucking nowhere where if I die I'm only killing myself. The majority of the US is in the middle of fucking nowhere there's no excuse. 30-45 minutes outside of most major cities is usually on the edge of civilization. 

ALSO STOP DOING STUPID SHIT (this applies more for the slow cars I own). When I'm in a car I don't drive in cars blind spots or stay next to a fucking car for any major amount of time (oh I can't see cars in that spot when I'm driving? Maybe I shouldn't position my vehicle there).

Going down the highway at 70 twisting it at 10k rpm or having hill billy cacklers on your Harley doesn't make you safer. IMAGINE WHAT YOU COULD DO IF YOU COULD RIDE THAT MOTHERFUCKER.

"It was running really rich and I changed the jet 1 size down, tried it and it worked reeally well, then after the little test I stopped riding, and the next day I went to ride and it was back to ""normal"" and it didn't work properly at all.

When the powerband kicks in, it works really well with full throttle, but AFAIK not perfectly since my friend had the same cylinder etc... exactly everything I have and also the same bike, expect he had a smaller carb, 28 and I have 34.

And his gearing was better for acceleration etc so mine should be even better at top speed.. And the top speed was 145 km/h and mine barely does 120 km/h.

Also if i'm riding at a slow speed lets say on the 3rd gear, with low throttle because that's my only option right now because it's either that, or full throttle.

So then I want to accelerate, and I drop to 2nd gear, it takes literally like 10+ seconds to hit the powerband even when I drop a gear and open the throttle fully. It's just like not accelerating smoothly at all, like it's ""glitching"" and like about to hit the powerband but then it just doesn't and it keeps glitching like that and randomly kicks in at some point.

Same thing happens with any gear so i'm just riding with low throttle 5th gear and then drop to 4 and maybe even have to drop to 3, it takes ages for the powerband to kick in and it doesn't sound good at all when it like glitching and the powerband is trying to kick in but it's like nah lets wait 5-10 more seconds without doing anything just riding with full throttle open and then boom it kicks in.

Also, the idle is really weird, sometimes when I look at the revs on the screen it's at like 3-4k and it should be around 1,5k. So then I ride a little bit, stop and now it's about 1,5k and then it randomly might jump back to 3-4k immediately, or if I go and ride and stop again it might be 3-4k etc..

And it happens everytime I start the bike, I look at the screen and it shows 3-4k and my neighbours probably think I don't know how to ride because whenever I leave with the 1st gear the revs drop and you can clearly hear it when the revs drop from 4k to 1.5k lol. Sounds kinda dumb.

And always whenever i'm rolling with the clutch down, to slow down or to fully stop, the bike is always reeally close to dying so I have to keep on reving it and around the city that might not make me look very good and if some people are mad enough they might even call the cops if I just keep on reving and reving my bike to keep it going while i'm fully stopped, or if i'm rolling with the clutch down.","My A1 125cc only works properly with low throttle, or full throttle",1.0,motorcycle,SuddenVolume1,True

"I have an 2nd gen 08 SV650 streetfighter build, been riding scooters and motorcycles most of my life (21m) and feel like the suspension isn‚Äôt really all there (6 foot 4 225lbs). Slapped a devil pipe on it and got a lil ‚Äòboost‚Äô of power though it may be negligible. I was thinking of getting emulators for the forks and 0.95 springs with 15wt oil as well as a Penske rear shock and rearsets if I do ever decide to track it, but if I do put in $1500 or more into the bike, I may as well get something else and sell the thing, as I bought it for around $2k. 

TLDR What I do love about the SV is the flickability and the overall nimbleness of the bike. However the suspension and the overall lack of top end due to the nature of the vtwin is off putting. 

I have ridden an FZ6 and do like the powerband of the 600 i4 more than that of the vtwin on the SV. It‚Äôs a rocket past 10/11k or so. I do shorter rides and don‚Äôt necessarily want something upright as I prefer the lower slung position of the SV. Somehow to me this is more comfortable. 

Its only natural that I started looking to get into a 600 (or larger) super sport as I absolutely do not like heavy bikes or cruisers (rode an HD Road Glide Ultra from LA to SF a couple weeks after getting my M1). As it sits my SV weighs around 370 lbs. 

My riding style is tuned towards more aggressive canyon carving. Plain and simple. Being able to decently comfortable on the hwy is also another plus, but not the biggest factor. If I ever want to take my gf on a bike ride or trip, I can always go to my local eaglerider and rent something for the occasion

"So I‚Äôve Been dealing and troubleshooting my 06 GSXR 600 over the last week or so. Finally been really digging into it. I had coolant and oil mix as you can see in the pics as well as overheating. Hoping to get some more help and ideas from y‚Äôall so I can narrow down this issue and get back to riding this season...it‚Äôs the only thing that helps with my depression and PTSD...I know a lot of you know these bikes inside and out...

Few things came to mind on what could be the issue...

1- head gasket ( worst case scenerio )
2- water pump‚Äôs mechanical seal went bad
3- oil cooler went bad 
4- freeze plug popped due to me running only water wetter towards the end of the season ( it gets cold here )

What I‚Äôve done so far...
Started off my removing the water pump and inspecting the mechanical seal. From what I could tell it didn‚Äôt look like it had any issues but I ended up removing it anyways so I could visually inspect it better - it wasn‚Äôt easy to remove I made some punctures of my own on it but overall prior it seemed to be in decent conditions 

From there I ran a compression test as well as a leak down test. The compression test I got around 130 on all 4 cylinders. Test was done on a cold bike. 
Prior to this happening about a month before I also did a compression test and was getting around 150 on 3 cylinders and around 145 on another cylinder after running the bike. 

Leak down test I ran on all four cylinders using a harbor freight leak down tester so I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not the most accurate but can give an idea of where I stand. That test came back as follows...

Cylinder 1 - 70psi in. Holds 68
Cylinder 2 - 70 psi in holds 67 
Cylinder 3 - 70psi in holds 69
Cylinder 4- 70psi in holds 70

Next I removed the head and visually inspected the 2 out of the 3 freeze plugs the best I could. They seem to be in place , the third one you can‚Äôt see it unless you remove the the cam shafts and the cam chain. I didn‚Äôt want to do that yet until I rule everything else out. If I do end up having to take a look at the third freeze plug hopefully somebody can give me some tips on if it‚Äôs possible to mark the chain and keep it timed so it‚Äôs not a headache when I go to put it back together...

With those test results do you still think it could be a head gasket? What should I do next - Pressure test the cooling system ? Rebuild the water pump and oil cooler ? Or pull the camshaft journals so I can get a better look at all the freeze plugs and rule them out....

Any help is very much appreciated - I‚Äôm doing the best I can right now and trying to utilize forums , other peoples posts etc and learn as I go and not just throw parts at the bike uselessly but today I‚Äôm ready to order some parts and see if I can bring her back to life or if I‚Äôll need to do the head gasket  üëçüèªüëçüèª",2006 GSXR 600 oil and coolant mixing - HELP!,1.0,motorcycle,1d0wn5up,True

"The TLDR of this post is: Bought a airbag vest on revzilla and have had a bad luck all around.


I was extremely excited to have a airbag because I am new rider and have seen all the stats on it and how it helps with crashes. I had my myself measured out for one and I ordered one on revzilla and was extremely excited because I had waited 3 weeks to get one(because of a back order) and when I tried it on it was so loose that I could pull it off over my head fully sinched with the clips. When I called the revzilla rep to find a solution he asked me what my measurements are and he said yes that size should fit. I asked if I can do an exchange but the product is sold out in all sizes again!!!! The response I got was ""I can't make one appear and you will have to wait for stock to come in"". That means I lose the extra cash back I got for ordering during a promo period and have to wait another 3+ weeks to get a piece of gear that I already waited for. When I told the rep that the measurements were wrong on the website he said that has nothing to do with revzilla and its all on Helite.

"Trying to make a decision on these two bikes. My last bike was a 650KLR. I want something sporty though.

The 2007 CBR600RR has 13K miles. It was modified by the current (2nd owner) to make commuting easier. No fairings, 7"" headlight in front. Numerous upgrades (steel brake lines, power commander, handlebars etc.) According to owner, never been crashed, but the first owner had it on a trailer and it was rear ended, and it sat for awhile before the current owner bought it and made these modifications to make commuting easier (able to sit in a higher position.) As far as he knows it's never been crashed, just the trailer incident. Clean title. Looks nice, but I prefer the stock look, so I may end up purchasing cheap fairings later on if I went with this bike. He has headlight/bracket. Original cluster is still on the bike. 

The 2009 Ninja 650 is super clean. 21K miles.. All stock except M4 exhaust, lowered sport handlebars, fender eliminator. I like this one a lot, but it's 2 hours away.

I understand the CBR600RR is a super sport and the Ninja is a sport. I'm not too concerned about the power difference between the two.

Both are around $3500. I prefer the look of the Ninja more than the CBR600RR. If I bought the CBR600RR I would likely purchase a cheap fairing kit later on, which would add to the price.

I know Hondas are reliable, I don't know much about Ninjas though..

I didn‚Äôt ride it, but came back the next day to find that it only showed 7.6 volts. I disconnected the negative terminal, and a few hours or so later, i believe it showed 6.4. After trying to charge it more now, it‚Äôs only gone up to 8. Is this battery already dead and what might be causing these issues? I never had these issues on my car batteries and with the last battery, it didn‚Äôt act as though I had some kind of heavy drain taking away power, and as of right now I was checking it with the negative disconnected.

Sorry, not too familiar with modifying motorcycles. I just prefer the stock look, and I'd be getting an okay deal on it, so I figured it might be worth it to convert it back to stock.

Any idea how much it would cost for the fairing set for the front end? If you could link me to exactly what I need, I would appreciate it.

"Have a beautiful 1980 r65 BMW with an AGI-801 Lithium Ion Battery. Left the dash on for a few hours and the battery went dead on me.

I then proceeded to try and jump start the batter with a jump starter (after perusing google, this was obviously a terrible idea).

Took it to a basic auto shop, their scanner read it as &gt;10 V, and charged it for me back to 12.84 V.

Threw the battery back in the bike and am trying to start it without luck. Despite voltage level being okay and the cold crank coming out fine, the bike won't start. 

I found previous reddit and blog posts mentioning how if a lithium ion battery dies (drops below 10 V) it needs to just be replaced. Is this true? I'm not understanding how it can read well on both voltage and cold crank but be done for. Any thoughts?

"First off some info... I'm almost 40 years old and thinking of getting into motorcycles.  A close friend of mine let me learn on a 2000 Ninja 250, i drove it 20 miles in a parking lot over the last 2 weeks and picked up the basics quickly.   I know i have a \*lot\* to learn, but now im hooked on it and want one of my own.   the question comes up to where to start...

I know everyone says to start small and upgrade later - but i plan on buying a newer bike.  Fuel injected, TFT screen, ABS... etc   which means i don't want to get something smaller, like a ninja 400, get bored with it in 6 months, and have to deal with trade in value.. etc.   

I am a responsible person and understand the dangers of the hobby, however i've been told that a Kawasaki Z900 would be a perfect starter bike for someone that respects the power, and a great bike to grow into.   

I know the difference between the 250, because i also rode a '20 street triple RS which is similar in power to the Z900.  The Z900 also has drive modes which can limit the power as well, which would be a great idea for someone starting.   My plan is cruising only.  I'm not someone whose going to get out there and do a 3 gear full throttle pull or corner carving a week into owning it.

Basically im looking into a Ninja 400/600 or a Z900.    Just wondered what the general opinion was.  This is down the road after getting my endorsement, but im heavily researching it now.",Suggestion on a starter Kawasaki for a new but older/mature rider?,1.0,motorcycle,the_strike_eagle,True

"I just had a high side crash a couple of blocks from my house due to road debris + speedbump (+ negligence on my part.)

I had a chance to go for a quick errand on my shadow for the first time in about a week. Wanting to feel the breeze I cranked the throttle to about 30 mph (usually I cruise at 10-20 in my neighborhood) and suddenly I caught a glimpse of a speedbump (unmarked) about 40 feet infront of me. 

Under normal circumstances I think I would've been able to slow down the bike. This time my rear tire went for a 10 foot slide on a patch of loose sand/dirt.

"Hi all! I‚Äôm having trouble with keeping the rust away from my chain as I have to keep it outside and I live in the UK so it rains a fair bit. 
I have a cover that it stays under and I sprayed anti corrosion on all other metal parts, however I am unsure wether I can spray that on the chain too?
Currently I scrub the rust off with steel wool (it‚Äôs not too bad yet as the bike is brand new) whilst cleaning the chain, then I let that dry and spray WD-40. Then I dry that down with a rag and spray rock oil lubricant on.

"A friend of mine found two bikes in the shed behind his house, and is looking to sell them for next to nothing. He has a 1978 Honda HaWk 400 and 2000s Suzuki Savage 650. Which should I go for? (Note: I'm brand new to riding and can only pass on second hand info RE specs and conditions)

The 400 is in better condition. My buddy thinks the engine was rebuilt before it was shelved; he says the plugs are clean and with some oil, new brakes, and some new wires, it'll be running. I like the idea of starting on a bike with a smaller engine, but I feel like this bike could eventually become limiting. It has a 2 speed, semi-auto transmission (Hondamatic) and part of me thinks learning on the Savage (5 speed, manual) will make me a better, more versatile rider long-term. He's asking $500 for the HaWk.

I live in NYC and will be moving pretty slowly at first, but would eventually love to do longer rides out of state which makes me think the 650 cruiser would be better. But my friend is more skeptical about this bike and thinks I'll end up spending a lot more to get it running. I have some cash set aside for a bike, so I can probably afford to fix the bike if it's a better fit for me. He'll probably let the Suzuki go for $200-300. 

The HaWk is also older, which I think is cool, but would that make it more prone to breakdown?

"Sorry if this has been discussed to death already, but I didn't find anything straight off, so I'm posting here.  If there's a better place please let me know!

I have a little motorcycle--Suzuki GZ250.  I want to use it to commute and save money on gas.  The only reason I don't already drive it daily is that I like listening to podcasts or music on my commute (about 20 min. to and from work twice a day).

I bought a Torc helmet because it had high ratings, and after sending one back because it was too big, I had one that fit and would connect with my phone.  Unfortunately, after trying a dozen or so times, the bluetooth would shut off and I never made it out of my driveway with bluetooth working.

Is there a better helmet or a better system for listening to your phone with a motorcycle helmet?  I'm not interested in any phone functions, just podcasts, live streams of radio, and music saved to my phone.

The temp is just getting up to 80 where I live and in a few weeks, it'll be perfect riding temps all day, so I just want to be prepared.  thanks for any help!",Helmets and Bluetooth--am I doing it wrong?,1.0,motorcycle,tronk,True

"I have been contemplating buying a motorcycle for over a year. I finally was ready to buy, and then COVID happened, and decided it wasn't the right time.

So I started thinking about buying a couple of weeks ago and really had a hard time justifying the purchase to my wife.

In the middle of the pandemic, my wife, myself, and two other couples decided that we should plan a cross-country road trip. So we rented the RV and booked the trip.

Well, on Monday of this past week, one of the guys who rides said, ""you know, if you buy a bike, we can trailer it and ride at our big destinations.""

This changed my wife's thinking when I said that it would give us freedom from the RV and the group if we needed it, and we can enjoy some of the places that we want to experience alone.

She agreed!

SideBar: I live in Montgomery, Alabama.

So Tuesday is started my search for the bike I have been dreaming about for over a year; the Indian Scout Sixty!

To make a long story short, every dealership in AL, TN, GA, and FL can not hold inventory because they are selling so fast.

I called one last place; Indian in Pensacola Florida. They had 1 left: the 1133cc Standard Scout in deep water metallic.

I never thought the blue was a color I wanted, but as I looked at more pictures of other people who owned it, I thought it just looked like a great classic style bike.

But, this was on a Wednesday, and I needed it to be delivered before Friday. 

Terry at the dealership didn't even need me to beg, he got it set up and had someone ready to deliver my bike at noon the next day.

I am so excited because not only do I have my dream bike, but within a couple of days of receiving it, I will be riding it at Jackson Hole Wyoming, Yellowstone National Park, Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, Route 66, and the Grand Canyon.

Here is a picture of ""Blue!""

I tested the vacuum hose AND blew into the hose to see that gas comes out of the petcock when it's on the on and reserve setting. The carbs are sparking clean and there's no debris or dirt in the vacuum connector part of the carb. But here is the other weird thing, once the gas gets low... and I mean low to the point that \\I can still see it should JUST be high enough that I shouldn't have to switch it to reserve, it acts like I've full run out of gas.

"So basically I tore into the bike for a 20k mile service. Among a long list of things I did, I changed the fuel filter and the O-rings in the fuel pump assembly, had the injectors professionally cleaned and tested, and adjusted the valves that were being a little noisy.

Got it all back together now, and it starts and idles fine. But if you give it a quick blip of the throttle it doesn't really respond, gives a slight pop at most, and will almost stall. Driveability is piss poor, It's a struggle to get going in first, it wants to die out, and I can just barely get it to 20mph in 2nd-3rd gear. 

I've gone and double checked the valves, they're spot on. Could bad/incorrect O-rings in the fuel pump cause these issues? Anywhere I can order motorcycle specific O-rings and such?

Also, during this maintenance I had to remove the headlight assembly, so I pulled all the wiring out of the headlight and carefully draped it back on the frame. Now the headlight doesn't work, but all the other lights and everything works. I've gone over all the wiring, checked for pinches and whatnot, gone over my battery connections.

Figured it was from old gas since the last guy left it sitting. Opened it up, took apart the carbs, they were absolutely spotless, looked like someone has cleaned them yesterday. Put it all back together (after applying carb cleaner to the pins anyway). I didn't touch the idle pins bc they were covered and I don't know how deep it is to drill. And it still does it. I found and fixed a vacuum leak that was likely present before on the carb boots, changed the spark plugs to brand new ones. Hell, I even changed the battery because it was starting to go.

"Good morning everybody!

My boyfriend's birthday is coming up in June and I'd like to get him something motorcycle related as a gift. I can't buy him jackets and gear without him there and because he admits he's a little picky. 

I was thinking of getting him a lunch box/cooler to take to work with him. He is trying to ride the bike more to work to save on gas and mileage for his Jeep. He's also trying to make his lunches instead of getting fast food. I think something small enough to strap onto the back easily would be a good idea for him! He's used to keeping a fridge with him in the Jeep so access to cold beverages and snacks is important to him.

 I was  wondering if anyone has any recommendation?

For reference, he rides a 2019 Africa Twin. He also has a Honda 250 dirt bike (street legal) but he just got the Twin so he's been bonkers over that one right now. He doesn't want to add side bags etc because he wants to do a mixture of off and on road riding.

"My friend has a ninja 500 as a first bike. Ran very well for his first year of riding and has been nothing but trouble since. Dead rectifier, fixed that, got new tires, then had to replace the rotor, as it was starting to crumble (first Gen), petcock is broken, so fixing that, and just today it didn't want to stay on without full choke at idle, and still idled at only 500rpm. Took it for a spin anyway, got on the highway and audibly misfired twice, then died. It's now hard to start and dies immediately. 

So, long story short, he's fed up and wants something else. 
The main aspects the new bike should have:

- upright seating position
- decent touring abilities
- good enough light offroad for gravel / dirt roads
- somewhere around 500 ish cc / 50hp
- known for being reliable

We've been thinking of the 
- KLR 650;
- KLE 500 (more street oriented and probably quicker? How's reliability?)
- Perhaps the Honda CB500x (still a bit too expensive used in Germany)
- Royal Enfield Himalayan (heard good things and he likes the look of it)

" Nothing screams vintage quite like an old **distressed leather jacket.** They certainly remind you of a used pair of jeans. Once you lay your hands on a pair like these, it seems quite hard to throw them off.

What‚Äôs the reason for this? After all, it‚Äôs a versatile look!

You should grab a notebook and pencil now. Since you want to showcase your uniqueness, you should make notes. We‚Äôve got a super Awesome vintage look for you, so make yourself comfy on the couch.

## ULTIMATE COOLNESS¬†

You have now settled down, and now you will be guided around the city of fashion. Can you guess where we‚Äôll be for the day? That‚Äôs right!

This evening we are taking you to a heavy metal club, so you better be prepared. With this Distress leather jackets , you will get amazing sturdiness and edginess. Wearing that Leather Jacket is hard to beat for toughness and edginess.

**Let‚Äôs Get Starts!!**

When you are in a store to shop for a jacket, you know that deciding what to buy is not an easy choice. Among the many great options are casual denim ones, stylish trench coats, and practical fleece hoodies. However, the leather jacket remains an in-style, perennially popular choice over all kinds of jackets. There is simply no other outerwear that can compare with leather jackets in the sense that they are effortlessly chic and stylish. A classic black leather jacket has been the most popular for a long time, but millennials are fast becoming more receptive to¬†[**mens distressed leather jackets**](https://leatherings.com/mens-distressed-leather-jackets-coats/).

The current young generation appreciates its raw power and commanding appearance while retaining its progressively fading look. Be sure to choose a pair that fits you perfectly and adds form and structure to your build before you invest in the rugged version of the cult classic. Once you have found the best fit for you, styling it is a breeze.

## Combination with DISTRESSED LEATHER JACKET

These are some great ways to style a¬†**distressed leather jacket.** We‚Äôve compiled a list of the best distressed jackets the people are wearing now, and how to style them successfully:

Casual style is evident in a¬†**distressed leather jacket**. It goes great with a simple white T-shirt and jeans to take the outfit to the next level. The result is a refreshing, sexy look that‚Äôs perfect for a day out on the town or a night out drinking with friends.

Depending on the time of day, you can choose between white trainers and casually smart Chelsea Boots. A simple tee and jeans combo allows a heavily distressed coat to shine, so it stands out in all its faded glory. An essential style that‚Äôs very easy to pull off and carry is the ultimate look.

For a more brooding look, swap the white shirt for a V-neck black shirt if the white is a bit too good boy for you. To deliver an edgy background to your rough-up jacket, team the shirt with chinos or dark washed jeans. Accessorize with chunky bracelets and cool shades for a dark, mysterious, and dangerous look.

The enigmatic outlook can be changed into one that is playful and wild by wearing a boater hat or fedora. Adding the trendy headgear to your ensemble can help you exude a boyish charm if that‚Äôs more your style.

When applied in just the right places, distressing can transform leather into a new classic. Therefore, if you cannot make a decision regarding a casual outfit or a proper tailored look for a date-night, opt for a¬†**distressed leather jacket**¬†with your eyes closed.

Wearing something underneath the coat is the next most crucial question. Plush cashmere sweater with a V-neck speaks of elegance and style and complements a genuine leather jacket mens, cured or otherwise. Choose your colors according to your jacket and pair them with simple straight jeans or chinos. To make it even more chic, you may want to wear a white tee that peeks out from your sweater‚Äôs collar.

Many style enthusiasts choose a treated leather jacket as their final wardrobe essential. These Leather jackets are extremely versatile because they do not usually need any elaborate styling to appear good. Your coat is the main attraction of your outfit, so the rest of the pieces simply complement it and complete the look. So, you can wear this oversized jacket with even the simplest printed T-shirt, and it still looks edgy and stylish.

Moreover,¬†**distressed jackets**¬†have so much going on already. Keeping the jacket with too much flash or color will take away from its charm. The best choice is a simple top, so a monochrome or simple patterned top is fine.

The denim on denim look is very hard to pull off. Originally regarded as a disastrous combination, it has become more acceptable on the fashion circuit of late. Wear the¬†**distressed jacket**¬†with the double denim and you will look confident and stylish.

One‚Äôs off-duty staple outfit can be transformed into an outfit that belongs on the runway with the leather coat. But if you want to wear them top and bottom together, make sure they are of the same color and clean, unwashed tone. Wear shoes that are of a similar color palette to your jacket to synchronize your finished look. The outfit will look completely different in any other color.

Even though it may sound absurd to wear cured jackets with a more formal attire, it is not impossible to try it. In fact, the coat should only be lightly faded, not heavily distressed. With the traditional formal style, a brown Bomber Jacket looks exceptionally sharp. A slim-fit button down white shirt and dressy slacks can be worn with the jacket. You can finish off the look with a brown belt. Fitting your clothes correctly will earn you more brownie points.

Generally, if you opt for a more traditional look, you should avoid bulking up your pockets since bulking up can ruin the silhouette of the Leatherings.com. Try to make your appearance look streamlined and sleek.

Also, depending on where you are going and the weather, you can accessorize your outfit with a stole or muffler. It stands out from the leather-clad crowd and adds another dimension to your ensemble.

**Distressed leather jackets** make you stand out amongst the crowd. In addition, they never go out of style and are the ideal choice when you want to get dressed and go in a hurry. Leatherings.com offers you a wide variety of styles, colors, and colors at competitive prices, so you‚Äôll surely find the one that‚Äôs perfect just for you!

## CONCLUSION

Distressed leather jackets will never go out of style, so try one for yourself today. If you are going to wear it, however, make sure that it complements your outfit. A million ways exist to style your outfit, but the styling options above are just a few. Make your outfit look dazzling by adding a touch of you. All the same, don‚Äôt be hesitant. Good luck.

"Hiya everyone. So there's this airbag vest where the airbag *won't* deploy if you miss a payment. What do you think about this? Do you think it's unsafe? I personally think it's very unsafe. I mean yes, it will provide extra padding regardless. But it has the potential to ""fail"" when needed most. I just think the ones where you attach a cord to your bike are pretty much fool proof.  Technology doesn't need to be everywhere! 

&amp;#x200B;

From the article:

&gt; $399 for the basic vest, then if you want it to actually, you know, work, you have to pay a $12/month subscription fee 

&amp;#x200B;

"I am about to buy my first motorcycle and I am going to buy from the dealership. In an attempt to make this post useful for everyone I will try to keep it as dry as possible:

Buying: 2019-2021 KTM Duke 790

1. Do I need motorcycle insurance before I can leave the lot with the bike? What type(s) do I need? I am taking a safety class to reduce costs but I have still been quoted close to $200/month for inusrance. Is this normal for a new rider on a new bike?
2. The bike I am looking at is available at a dealership in my state (CA) and at a dealer in Reno NV. Does anyone have experience buying a bike out of state with a warranty? Can I have a shop here work on the bike? or ONLY that dealer? I live in Santa Cruz and there are no KTM dealers anywhere close. Just wondering how others manage this.

Any other tips would be greatly appreciated. I looked though a lot of posts here and couldn't find any clear answers for my questions. Sorry if this has been answered elsewhere.

Hello All!

I recently purchased a tune from BrenTuning for my Panigale V2 and I have to say I LOVE it. It pairs great with my de-cat slip on exhaust. BrenTuning gave me an upmap for 93 fuel and a separate one for Race Fuel. I recently purchased 110 Octane race fuel and I‚Äôm wondering if it will do any harm to my bike or not if paired with the race fuel upmap. Should I exchange for a lower octane? If anyone needs any more information I can provide it, I am very ignorant on this subject.

"I am a newb, self-taught but with at least a few years of experience under my belt. I've had zero introduction to biker culture before I started riding. And since then, I've had several strangely hostile interactions with other bikers. I'm unsure if this is just ""grumpy biker stereotype"" or something else? Of course, not all bikers are unfriendly. But I have noticed a lot of ""mean girls"" comments, always from big, tough looking white guys. And it's not just the Harley guys- the white guys at the Norton meetup treated me in the same, un-cool way. My neighbor who has 3 different BMW's? Same story, I try to be friendly and he treats me like trash. Even after going to a mechanic and literally paying the man a good deal of money, the mechanic goes on a long tirade about my bike being ugly. It all seems to add up ""straight white men don't want anyone else riding.""  


Is it because I'm a newb?  
Or is it because my bike is Japanese?  
Or is it because I'm gay?  
Or maybe it's just a culture I'm unfamiliar with?  


It doesn't really bother me, because I like ride to be by myself. I don't need anyone's approval. But I just want to point out that of all the riders I've met, the coolest have been the Dykes on Bikes. (Not a slur, that's actually the name of the group) When when of those girl's bikes broke down in front of my house, I let her park in my garage until a tow truck could be found. And since then, they've been endlessly helpful and all around fun.

"Long story short about 5 days ago I crashed my brand new bike because I lost focus, lost traction on the front tire and highsided pretty hard. Ankle broken in two places, shoulder broken. ATGATT saved my life or at least my ability to walk in the future, since I landed right on my back and it's mostly unaffected. Bike is also kinda trashed but I have full insurance. 

Everyone is telling that I should be grateful because it could've been worse. That the metal repairs itself. That bones take longer. All that. Which is fair, of course.  

But it feels like I'm being denied from feeling mentally affected. I keep having nightmares and flashbacks of the crash. Remembering the inability to stand up and my jewel of a bike crashed keeps giving me anxiety and ruins my day. And I can't wait to go back to therapy.

"Keep trying to look for a good solution for music in my helmet that's not too bad, sound quality wise. I keep seeing people mention either Plugfones or, for what seems like a step up in quality, comply tips matched with some low profile earbuds (would love some suggestions on earbuds, if anyone has some, especially if you guys know of some low profile, full wireless earbuds). Do the comply tips actually provide sufficient noise reduction to prevent hearing loss while on the bike though? If so, this seems ideal for me, I don't care too much about communicating with other riders, currently. 

Things I'm stuck on. Which set of earbuds to buy. I see a lot of people mention the SE215, which look great, as long as the noise cancellation with Comply tips is enough to be safe. I'm a little worried that the design won't fit my left ear perfectly, I have a little leftover cauliflower ear that makes some earbuds not want to stay perfectly. Something like the Jabra Elites would be even better, do away with wires completely, but same issue, just want to confirm that the Comply tips are alright. 

Plugfones seem okay, but reviews make it sound like they break often and the audio quality is just passable. But I'd be okay using those and replacing them regularly, I suppose.

Anyway, I own a 2019 Kawasaki Z650 ABS and am having an electrical issue. Recently, around the time I was changing my headlight, my turn signals stopped working, along with the hazards. There is also no blinking or sound coming from the dash idicator arrows. 


First I checked the fuses,  and couldn't find one specifically for the turn signals. All the fuses in the box are ok. I tested them with a fuse tester.  I tried to check connections and made sure everything that I could access looked alright with tight connections.  Bear in mind I did switch out both front and rear stock turn signals for LED flush mounted ones last year, but never had an issue with them since. Worked fine. 


When researching I read to check or replace the relay. I replaced the stock one with a new aftermarket relay for LED lights.  Figured I might as well do that since I probably should have when i first connected the LED turn Signals.


 So, I couldn't find a specific fuse for turn signals but all fuses are good. There is a new relay. Still nothing. I'm stumped. I do have one of those 2 prong voltage testers and haven't been able to get it to light up when touching to the pins in turn signal harness, but I don't know if that should light up anyway under those circumstances.  


Does anyone know if there is a specific fuse for the turn signals that I just can't locate?  The manual was unclear in that sense.

"I know....one's a naked bike and the other is a cruiser, but hear me out. I need third party opinions. I mainly only have owned sport bike style bikes and that is why it's so hard for me to decide. I rode my uncles '07 V Star 650 today and liked it, but it's 100lbs give or take heavier and less nimble and slower (which could be a good thing) which I just needed to get used to. I did enjoy riding it. There was also some I didn't like on the cruiser. Brakes for one, but I think that's more on the fact his bike is much older and could use new pads and fluid.

My mind tells me a cruiser would be nice to own. Better on highway and longer rides, more comfortable, etc. I'm just more used to the riding position on street bikes (I just sold my KTM Duke 390). I want to have the option of highway riding and also do longer rides.

&amp;#x200B;

My main issues with my most recent Duke 390 were the jerky throttle at low speed in traffic, pretty bad on the highway obviously, uncomfortable seat, and a lot of vibration being a big single.

MSRP for each is within a couple hundred dollars of each other. On a cruiser i would be less tempted to go fast, which does seem safer.

I'm sure everyone else had a crappy 2020. For me, it was rock bottom, in a million ways but at least one good thing happened- I got my motorcycle certification. When I lost my job, I should have saved my money. Instead, I spent 750$ on ""Bruce"" and over the past year, I've put 7000 miles on the odometer. It's been one of the happiest experiences of my life to explore the PNW and sadly, I need to get back to the day job. But I'm glad I took the time to learn something new, because a few years ago, I never would have thought I could ride a bike, much less maintain one. 

Yesterday, I went in for a yearly checkup and the guy tells me ""not to throw good money after bad"" and that I'd have a hard time finding anyone willing to work on such an old bike.  Not sure if I'm being overly-sentimental but I've decided to step up my mechanics game and dedicate myself to keeping Bruce running as long as I can, because I want thank my bike for getting me where I want to go, and for being the most reliable thing in my life right now.

As the motorcycle is my daily rider, I use it to get it to the office and ride to different meetings and events throughout the day.

I tried many different ways to stay safe while riding and yet look decent at the office (from wearing under-layer with protection, up to packing the blazer in my saddlebags), but frankly none of them worked for me.

That‚Äôs how, I came to the idea to create the first blazer for motorcyclists - The Brummell Blazer ([ridebrummell.com](https://ridebrummell.com/)). It is an elegant and classy blazer, with the protection of a motorcycle jacket (abrasion resistant, CE Level 2 Impact protectors, etc).

"I've posted about this before so I'll summarise - I own a 2014 YBR125 and the speedo on it stopped working.

Recently, while trying to troubleshoot the problem, I took one end of the connecting cable out and spun the wheel, and nothing happened. Then, while still spinning the wheel, I pushed the cable in a little and it sort of clicked into place and started spinning as it should. It would then work properly (from what I found forever) unless I spun the wheel backwards, even a little bit. After that, it would stop spinning with the wheel and I'd have to click it into place again.

So I guess the problem is that the wire disconnects in some way from the gear that drives it when the wheel is spun in reverse (which is impossible to avoid).

"I'm not sure if you guys get a lot of help requests on this subreddit, I haven't seen any myself so I apologize if this is the wrong place.

Alright guys so I'm pretty new to motorcycle and such but I was in a parking lot last week doing some low speed maneuvers and such, just practicing, and I happened to drop my 01' CBR600F4I, it was no problem, I was going extremely slow just lost balance, I picked it up and thought all was well. Then none of the electronics were working, the time wasn't showing, neutral light, headlight, everything was off, so I jump started it and it worked for about a minute or so and then it died again, I jump started it a couple more times and it just kept dying. At first I thought it was the tip over sensor but I quickly realized it wasn't when the battery started leaking acid and smoking. I just backed off and let it do its thing.

I had a mechanic come to the parking lot and bring a battery and quickly replace it as I had work in the next hour (cost me $200 :( 80 for the battery 100 for coming in such short notice) anyway, motorcycle is now turning on fine and I rode it home no problem, haven't ridden it since in fear it might happened again.

Now what I kind of need help with is identifying the cause of the problem. The mechanic that installed the battery said that with the little time he looked at it, he thinks that the positive terminal of the battery was hitting the inside metal cage which would pretty much cancel out the grounding (negative side) I've never heard of a battery smoking because of that but I'm assuming he knows more than me so I didn't rule it out. Now with my little time researching what could've happened, the main cause I came upon was the battery overcharging, so basically the rectifier failing to do its job. I've ordered a multimeter to test the battery voltage and some terminal covers so the metal isn't touching any other metal, and if all seems good I don't know what else it could have possibly been.

What doesn't make sense to me is why it happened right after I dropped it, if it was the rectifier wouldn't the battery smoke while i was riding it in high revs and such? I also don't understand why it just died after I dropped it.

(The mechanic also told me if I was going at high speeds the battery would've literally blown up from underneath me idk if this helps or not but yeah)

"Hey All,

So I plan to buy a dual sport this year. I don't have a trailer but have seen these motorcycle carriers that go into your hitch and hang off the back of your car (2 inch hitch - 500lb capacity)

The bikes I'm looking at buying are dual sports... so we're looking at 300lbs - 340lb bikes with fuel.

Bike + Carrier would be 370-380 lbs.... 

I have a Toyota Rav4 V6 with a class III hitch (500 lb tongue weight).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm on the fence about using one of these. Will the leverage/torque of the bike cause damage to my frame? My hitch is rated for this weight as is the carrier....

"Got my first bike last fall, didn't get to ride because an issue was causing it to not shift into first (or to stall despite shifting?). I'm looking to fix that problem now to hopefully learn to ride this season, but first, now it won't start. 

Problem 1: Starting it just sounds like it's not getting gas. I first thought it must have been the battery dying (as I had no storage for it over winter) but the batter seems to work fine. Lights and gage works. It kind of just sounds like it's choking. I put gas in it before winter and didn't realize all the precautions you were suppose to take with bikes over winter, until about the end. The gas is still in there, I now have to check the tires for soft spots, etc. Just wondering if the gas could be the reason it's not starting?

Problem 2: When it was starting, I thought I was just stalling it. But I had a few experienced riders try to get it going and none of them could (I moved over winter so I'm no longer around them for help). The bike seems like it does shift, but as you put in throttle, it just lurches forward and dies. Some said it's the clutch, or the stand safety, or the carburetor. Is there any tests I could do (if I get it running again) to find out which of these would be the issue?

"Hi guys, I am a new rider, just learning how to ride now and yesterday youtube suggested me a video and I watched it. The guy was talking about adjusting the suspension of the bike before taking a passenger. If you're riding by yourself, adjust it, if you'll take a passenger with you, adjust it as well.

Maybe it's because I never rode a bike before, even though I have friends who do it. But I never saw or heard anyone talking about this before. Do you guys really adjust your suspension whenever preparing to ride with a passenger?

So I learn how to ride a bike when I was probably 7 years old so my sister thought it would be a great idea to teach me how to ride a motorcycle when I was 9-10 years old. Of course, being the only son, my father approves my 13 years old sister to teach me how to ride a motor.. at first it was just our scooter. It turns out fine and kind of fun so after a day of us riding a basic scooter we decided to try my dad's motor (its definitely heavier and it has a clutch ).

I just recently bought my first motorcycle (Image related) and am trying to take the responsible route by getting all the gear and actions done before riding this bad boy, but I am in a conflict. The helmet I want to purchase online has 2 sizes that my head shape teeters on, I measured my head at 60cm but when moving the measuring tape up or around my head, it may go to 61cm or over 60cm by a bit and the two sizes in question, L (59cm-60cm) and XL (60cm-61cm) are divided by those measurements.  
As good looking as the helmets are, they're quite pricey and I would rather only buying one for now until I bump my head warranting another. Any help?

Looking to buy my first Airbag and these are my final 3 options:  


I like the fact that the bering is hooked to the front of the bike and can therefore detect a potential slide or impact **and deploy prior to hitting the ground**.   


Seems like the Helite Turtle 2 offers the most protection of all the 3, but I am skeptical that it will deploy as fast when sliding if I ""still hold"" the bike at some point during the sliding. 

&amp;#x200B;

As for the Custom Leather, I think it is the the best looking one, and seems like it offers the same protection as the Turtle 2, except it doesn't go as long in the back.

Only experience i have is with my 2 stroke 180cc scooter which does well over 150km/h.

" 

Hello, Currently me and my fianc√© are having a repetitive fight. Motorcycles.  
Some back story behind my love for bikes. I was 12 and my dad took me to the 2015 Chicago Car Show, and in the middle of BMW Booth was a new 2015 S1000RR. I thought it was the most beautiful piece of machinery I have ever seen, I grew up in huge car family and I'm a huge gearhead because of it since then I've owned 3 cars a fast Four Wheeler (Raptor 700) and a 50cc Moped. Since that day I promised myself that when i turned 18 and had money I would get one i spent the next 5 years just researching them day in and day out, No one will stop me. Well now I'm 18, in the military I've saved up a bit of cash and i plan on taking the military MSF course.

But here's the main issue, I've been telling my fianc√© I've wanted a bike since we started dating 2 years ago. Now she refuses to let get one. She used the same lines most people use to convince their loved ones not to get a bike. ""What if you die, how do you want me to deal with that"" ""its way more dangerous then a car"" ""i wont marry you if you get one"" and my FAVORITE "" I refuse to have a kid if you're just gonna die on a bike""

So tonight i just told her, ""I'm gonna get one and i know the dangers and I've experience a taste of it on my moped accident and I don't care, I wont let anyone get in the way of my dream I've had for the last 6 years"" I've explained to her my deep passion for bikes many times. But it ended up in my looking like the bad guy because I didn't consider her feelings. I offered to only ride in day light and start on very small bikes like the MT-03 or XT250 and limit roads with a speed limit less then 55Mph and selling my Jackson Soloist Collection and my Amp to fund my bike.

I want to know if I'm in the wrong for standing my ground on my dream or if I should just sacrifice it to make her happy. ultimately I want her to be happy. But I cant just let go of something i have such a deep love and passion for. Am I the asshole?",My love of motorcycles Vs Fiance,1.0,motorcycle,Interaction-Federal,True

"I got my endorsement about 2 weeks ago. Did 4 full days of demos at Bike Week Daytona. This incident happened on the 3rd day while demoing an Indian FTR. The Indian demos were self guided so I was by myself. 

After leaving the demo staging area I was in the right lane and came upon a group of 20-30 riders in tight side by side formation in the center lane. Minding my own business I began slowly passing the group. They quickly moved into my lane with no warning. 

I did not panic or brake hard while maintaining about the same speed. The rider in front of me began waving his arm telling me to get in the center lane. I had one of their riders to my left and others were now behind me so I was basically stuck.

Then one their riders forced me into the bicycle lane, pulled in front of me and forced me to almost completely stop. WTF, I was pissed!

I did notice that they all were wearing MC club vests. When I finished my demo I searched their club. Wikipedia says they are supposed to be a 1% outlaw club.

"Hello,

I‚Äôm looking into purchasing my first bike soon, but I want to do as much research as I can beforehand to understand the basics of riding properly and safely.

From what I‚Äôve gathered so far, the front brake is responsible for 70% of the stopping power on a motorcycle, and is generally used in most situations regarding slowing down gradually or stopping completely. The rear brake, however, doesn‚Äôt seem to get as much mention. So far, it seems it‚Äôs only really used:

- to prevent rolling back on a slope or hill
- to gradually reduce speed while still constantly moving like in slower traffic or in a parking lot
- in conjunction with the front brake during an emergency stop

I‚Äôm sure there are other real-world applications for the rear brake, and there may be more than one correct answer based on the situation at hand, but could someone please help clarify for me when it‚Äôs best to use the rear brake over the front?",New rider question: when should I use the rear brake versus the front brake?,1.0,motorcycle,GoesToHollywood,True

Well... not sure why I didn‚Äôt notice as I would do quick checks before riding but I noticed today the oil gauge had... no oil. Now, I‚Äôm not riding like crazy but could I have legitimately burned all the oil on a new bike in 6 days? I‚Äôve ridden only 315 miles on it since I got it on Friday.

Now I think this is where I made my 2nd mistake, I bought oil to put in (I have the receipt as proof) and as soon as it filled up, i saw that clear gold oil turn black thru the glass gauge on the side of the motor... if I take it back to the dealer tomorrow do I have a fighting chance at claiming the bike had no oil to begin with and that I had to buy some in an emergency as I was out on the road.

"Hi

I really love the look of very old motorcycle (think about Nortons from the 40's) but owning one is not possible for me.

It's too expensive, and even if I had one, I wouldn't ride it every day. Every mile driven is like getting the bike one mile closer to it's grave. I wouldn't enjoy it as much as a new bike with a retro look, there are plenty of them.

  


So I was wondering, what makes a very old bike too old? Once you've rode 200k miles on it, what needs to be changed in order to make it ride 200k miles more?

"Hi all, I am looking into buying a bike for a bit of a project. The seller is saying that the fuel system is leaking and the bike will not start because of that issue.  They said it does however try to turn over. The bike is a older bike that is carbureted. Is there a way I can check and see if the engine is still good on the bike with out it running? What might be some common fixes for a bike with fuel issues. Lastly is it common for a bike to stop working because of fuel issues? The bike only costs about $300 so I think I‚Äôll end up taking a chance on it anyway. Any comments are welcome! Thanks!","Hi, I‚Äôm looking for some advice about a bike I‚Äôm interested in buying.

"I was talking to my friend about getting a bike and I said I want to schedule my bike permit. I'm 20 and obviously l have a driver's license, but not a bike one.

It left me thinking would it be easier to just get an MJ permit and than apply for the MSF course or just apply to the course with the form you fill out through an msf site? I'm in Buffalo NY btw

"I own a motorbike in Colombia and well, here‚Äôs something different. A lot of thievery for this type of vehicle, accidents, and people not complying with the law (regarding the helmet use).

Last year I spent a few hundred bucks buying the intercom plus an extraordinarily complex GPS system. In the end, I have to use 2 apps plus a lot of devices from different brands to get an anti-theft and an intercom system.

I saw from an Influencer here in Colombia, that soon a new product will be launch into the market. It is called Helmy and basically, it includes an Intercom, an antitheft system plus an automatic notification to a third party in case you suffer an accident. On top of that, the motorbike will not start if you do not wear the helmet in the right position and the design is so cool.
